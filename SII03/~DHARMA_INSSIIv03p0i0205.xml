                            <p>The subjoined set of copper-plates discovered so early as September 1905, has been fully described in the Director-General's <hi rend="italic">Archaeological Survey Report</hi> for 1903-04, pp. 233-5. Its contents are discussed in the <hi rend="italic">Madras Epigraphical Report</hi> for 1916, Part II, paragraphs 11 to 20. The plates and the massive seal<note>See back of the accompanying plate XIX, bottom.</note> on which they are hung weigh 8 maunds, 2 visses and 20 palams and are thus nearly three times as heavy as the Paiṭhaṇ record of A.D. 1272 pronounced by Dr. Fleet to be an epigraphic curiosity in respect of its weight.<note><hi rend="italic">Imperial Gazetteer of India</hi> (The Indian Empire), Vol. II, p. 33.</note> The <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> plates consist of thirty-one copper-sheets; whereas the so-called larger Leyden plates of the same dynasty already published<note><hi rend="italic">Archaeological Survey of Southern India</hi>, Vol. IV, pp. 204 ff.</note> contain only twenty-one. The former supply also more information about the early <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> kings than the latter. An earlier set of <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> copper-plates issued by king <hi rend="bold">Uttama-Chōḷa Madhurāntaka</hi>, the grand-uncle of <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> I., has been published above.<note>Pp. 264 ff.</note> A set of still earlier copper-plates was recently discovered by Mr. T.A. Gopinatha Rao at Anbil. They belong to the time of <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Chōḷa Parāntaka</hi> II., the father of <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> I., and are being edited by him in the <hi rend="italic">Epigraphia Indica</hi>.</p>						
                            
                            <p>The Sanskrit and Tamil portions of the <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> grant were written at different periods, as has been already pointed out by Mr. Venkayya,—the latter at the time to which the inscription refers itself and the former about at least a decade later. A detached inscription written in continuation of the Sanskrit portion on sheet <hi rend="italic">Xa</hi> and continued on (<hi rend="italic">Xb</hi>), is stated by Mr. Venkayya to be a later addition.<note>The accompanying facsimile Plates XIII to XVI (part of <hi rend="italic">Xa</hi>) completely illustrate the Sanskrit portion. The detached Tamil inscription of the later period is illustrated on plate XVI (part of <hi rend="italic">Xa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Xb</hi>). The rest of the plates illustrate the Tamil record. Copper sheets <hi rend="italic">VIIb</hi> to <hi rend="italic">XVIIb</hi> which contain only the description of the boundary line are not illustrated.</note> It registers a grant made to the shrine of the goddess at <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi>, perhaps contemporaneously with the grant of <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> to the temple of <hi rend="bold">Mahādēva</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Śiva</hi>) of that place, but put into writing <hi rend="italic">long</hi> after. The characters of the detached record are paleographically at least one or even two centuries later than the characters of the <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> grant and it is difficult to explain why a gift made to the shrine of the goddess in the 6th year of <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> I. must have been kept without being reduced to writing for such a long period. In this connexion it deserves to be noted that separate shrines of goddesses in Śiva temples are, generally, of much later origin than the original Śiva temples themselves and that in the stone inscriptions registered on the walls of the <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> temple the shrine of the goddess is referred to for the first time only in a record of the 10th year of <hi rend="bold">Tribhuvanachakravartin Rājādhirāja</hi> II., <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, in A.D. 1173—clearly 155 years after the date of the subjoined copper-plate grant.</p>						
                            
                            <p>The tradition of the place <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> intimately connects it with <hi rend="bold">Ammai</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Kāraikkāl-Ammai</hi>, a great devotee of Śiva who, under the orders of that god, put on a dreary emaciated appearance and worshipped his dancing form at <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi>. The name <hi rend="bold">Ammai-Nāchchiyār</hi> which occurs in the detached inscription on plate XVI as a name of the goddess of the temple does not so appear in the stone records of <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi>. No. 469 of the <hi rend="italic">Madras Epigraphical Collection</hi> for 1905 calls her <hi rend="bold">Periya-Nāchchiyār</hi>; in another record her name occurs as <hi rend="bold">Vaṇḍārkuḻal Nāchchiyār</hi> (No. 497 of 1905), which is still current in its Sanskrit form <hi rend="bold">Bhramarālakāmbā</hi>. The god himself is named <hi rend="bold">Ammaiyappa</hi> in v. 129. He was perhaps so named on account of his being kind as a father to his devotee <hi rend="bold">Ammai</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Kāraikkāl-Ammai</hi>. Both the names <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> (or <hi rend="bold">Paḻaṉai)</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> occur in the <hi rend="italic">Dēvāram</hi> hymns. In the hymn sung by <hi rend="bold">Sundaramūrti-Nāyaṉār</hi> the goddess is referred to as <hi rend="bold">Vaṇḍārkuḻali-Umainaṅgai</hi> and the god himself as <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr-Ammā</hi>. It is not impossible that in the names <hi rend="bold">Ammaiyappaṉ</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Ammai-Nāchchiyār, Ammā</hi> is synonymous with the god of <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi>. The story of <hi rend="bold">Kāraikkāl-Ammai</hi> is not referred to in the <hi rend="italic">Dēvāram</hi> so called. But the eleventh <hi rend="italic">Tirumuṟai</hi> of the sacred collection which describes the god at <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> was the composition of <hi rend="bold">Kāraikkāl-Ammai</hi> herself and the place of honour is given to it as <foreign>mūttattiruppatikam</foreign>.</p>						
                            
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">praśasti</hi> of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> family conveyed by the Sanskrit portion of the grant (vv. 1 to 137) consists of 271 lines and is mostly Puranic.<note>See footnotes on the translation.</note> In verse 4 are introduced the Sun and <hi rend="bold">Manu</hi>, the latter of whom was produced from the Sun by concentration of mind. His son was <hi rend="bold">Ikshvāku</hi> (v. 5); his son <hi rend="bold">Vikukshi</hi> (v. 6); his son <hi rend="bold">Purañjaya</hi> (v. 7) surnamed <hi rend="bold">Kakutstha</hi> (v. 8); his son <hi rend="bold">Kakshīvat</hi> (v. 9) and his son <hi rend="bold">Aryaman</hi> (v. 10). In this family was born <hi rend="bold">Analapratāpa</hi> (v. 11); in his family was born <hi rend="bold">Vēna</hi>; and his son born from the right arm was <hi rend="bold">Pṛithu</hi> (vv. 12 and 13). In his family was born <hi rend="bold">Dhundhumāra</hi>, so called on account of his having killed the demon <hi rend="bold">Dhundhu</hi> (v. 14). In (his) family was born <hi rend="bold">Yuvanāśva</hi> (v. 15); his son was <hi rend="bold">Māndhātṛi</hi> who ruled the earth as far as the <hi rend="bold">Lōkālōka</hi> mountain (v. 16); his son was <hi rend="bold">Muchukunda</hi> who, by killing the demon <hi rend="bold">Kālayavana</hi>, pleased the god <hi rend="bold">Mukunda</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Vishṇu</hi> (v. 17). In (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) family was born king <hi rend="bold">Vaḷabha</hi><note>This name is perhaps to be taken as the origin of the Tamil word <hi rend="italic">Vaḷavaṉ</hi> which in Tamil literature generally is synonymous with Chōḷa. It is not impossible that <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> Vaḷabha is a Sanskritised form of the Tamil <hi rend="italic">Vaḷavaṉ</hi>. If the latter is true, his founding the town of Valabhī in Sanrāshṭra must have been purely an invention of the poet's imagination. In v. 106 below, Rājēndra-Chōḷa is called the ornament of the Vaḷabha race. But it must be remembered that Tamil literary tradition strongly supports the advent of the early Tamil kings in Northern India,—a Chēra king named Imayavaramban being even supposed to have carried arms into that country.</note> who founded the city of <hi rend="bold">Vaḷabhī</hi> (v. 18); his son was <hi rend="bold">Pṛithulāksha</hi> who set the mountain <hi rend="bold">Mandara</hi> whirling in the ocean for securing nectar (v. 19); his son was <hi rend="bold">Pārthivachuḍāmaṇi</hi> (v. 20). In (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) family was born <hi rend="bold">Dīrghabāhu</hi> (v. 21) and then came <hi rend="bold">Chandrajit</hi><note>The account given does not specify the exact relationship of Chandrajit to Dīrghabāhu. The name Chandrajit perhaps suggests the racial enmity which the kings of the Solar race entertained towards those of the Lunar.</note> (v. 22); his son was <hi rend="bold">Sāṅkṛiti</hi> who became the emperor at the close of the Kṛita age (v. 23). In that family was born <hi rend="bold">Pañchapa</hi> (v. 24)<note><hi rend="italic">I.e.</hi>, the protector of the five (kings). The Pāṇḍyas are generally known as Pañchavar and are traditionally connected with the five Pāṇḍava brothers of the <hi rend="italic">Mahābhārata</hi>.</note> ; in his family was born <hi rend="bold">Satyavrata</hi> who conquered <hi rend="bold">Kāśirāja</hi>, the king of <hi rend="bold">Vāraṇāsi</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Benares) (v. 25) and acquired the title <hi rend="bold">Rudrajit</hi> (v. 26) by conquering Rudra in battle. In that family was born <hi rend="bold">Śibi</hi>; an ornament of his family was king <hi rend="bold">Marutta</hi><note>The story of Marutta is related in the <hi rend="italic">Mahābhārata</hi> and agrees with what is stated of him in the inscription.</note> who was an immediate predecessor of the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍavas</hi> (vv. 27 and 28). In his family was born <hi rend="bold">Dushyanta</hi>; his son was <hi rend="bold">Bharata</hi> and his son was <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> after whose name the Solar race on this earth became known as <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> (v. 29) and who ruled the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> country which was abundantly rich (v. 30). <hi rend="bold">Chōḷavarman's</hi> son was <hi rend="bold">Rājakēsarivarman</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Rājakēsarin's</hi> son was <hi rend="bold">Parakēsarin</hi> (vv. 30 and 31). These two names were used as titles alternately by the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> kings in the order of their coronation (v. 32). <hi rend="bold">Parakēsarin's</hi> son was <hi rend="bold">Chitraratha</hi>; his son was <hi rend="bold">Chitrāśva</hi> and his son, <hi rend="bold">Chitradhanvan</hi> (v. 33). It is stated that this last king <hi rend="bold">Chitradhanvan</hi> brought into his dominions the river <hi rend="bold">Kavērakanyakā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Kāvērī, just as <hi rend="bold">Bhagīratha</hi> brought into the earth <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgā</hi>, the river of the gods (v. 35). In that family was born <hi rend="bold">Suraguru</hi> entitled <hi rend="bold">Mṛityujit</hi> (v. 36). In his family was born <hi rend="bold">Chitraratha</hi> who bore the title <hi rend="bold">Vyāghrakētu</hi> after his banner on which was the figure of a tiger. He also bore as an ornament on his head the flowers of the <hi rend="italic">dhātakī</hi> (v. 37).<note>Tamil literature refers to the tiger-banner and the string of <hi rend="italic">ātti</hi> flowers (<hi rend="italic">Tomentosa</hi>) which were emblematic of Chōla royalty.</note> His son was <hi rend="bold">Narēndrapati</hi> who became king at the end of the Trētā age. His son was king <hi rend="bold">Vasu</hi> entitled <hi rend="bold">Uparichara</hi> on account of his having received a celestial car from Indra by which he moved about in all directions (v. 39). In his family was born <hi rend="bold">Viśvajit</hi> at the close of the Dvāpara age (v. 40). Thus verses 4 to 40 supply names of kings who ruled in the Kṛita, Trētā and the Dvāpara ages and as such can hardly be of any interest to the student of history, excepting perhaps the euponymous name <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> and the titles <hi rend="bold">Rājakēsarivarman</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Parakēsarin</hi> of the Trētā age.</p>						
                            
                            <p>Coming to the rulers of the Kali age, the first king mentioned is <hi rend="bold">Perunatkiḷḷi</hi> who was born in this same family and was highly learned (v. 41). In his race was born <hi rend="bold">Kalikāla</hi> who renovated the town of <hi rend="bold">Kāñchī</hi> with gold and established his fame by constructing flood-embankments for the river <hi rend="bold">Kāvērī</hi>. The poet explains the name <hi rend="bold">Kalikāla</hi> as ‘the god of Death (<hi rend="italic">Kāla</hi>)’ either to the <hi rend="italic">Kali</hi> age or to the elephants (<hi rend="italic">kari</hi>) of his enemies (v. 42). Evidently here, the tradition recorded in Tamil literature that the name <hi rend="bold">Karikāla</hi> ‘the burnt-leg’ was derived from an accident which happened to the king while yet he was a boy, was either not known or was purposely ignored by the �logist. In that family was born <hi rend="bold">Kōchcheṅgaṇṇāṉ</hi> whose former birth as a spider and deep devotion to Śiva are described in verse 43. The story of <hi rend="bold">Kōchcheṅgaṇṇāṉ</hi> is found in the <hi rend="italic">Periyapurāṇam</hi> under the name <hi rend="bold">Kōchcheṅgaṭchōḻa-Nāyaṉār</hi>. He is there stated to have been the son of <hi rend="bold">Śubhadēva</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Kamalāvatī</hi> and to have constructed many Śiva temples in the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> country. The classic Tamil poem <hi rend="italic">Kaḷavaḻi</hi>, which is devoted to the history of his life, describes his defeat of the <hi rend="bold">Chēra</hi> king at <hi rend="bold">Kaḻumalam</hi>. In the family of <hi rend="bold">Kōchcheṅgaṇṇāṉ</hi> was born <hi rend="bold">Vijayālaya</hi> who took possession of <hi rend="bold">Tañchāpurī</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Tanjore) and there consecrated the goddess <hi rend="bold">Niśumbhasūdanī</hi> (vv. 44-46). With <hi rend="bold">Vijayālaya</hi> commences a regular genealogy of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷas</hi> whose capital was <hi rend="bold">Tanjore</hi>. The earlier <hi rend="bold">Chōḷas</hi> of literature whose traditional capital was <hi rend="bold">Uṟaiyūr</hi> and who preceded <hi rend="bold">Vijayālaya</hi> must have been in a decadent condition serving in some subordinate capacity under the powerful Pallavas. A Telugu branch of them ruling perhaps independently over a small tract of country in the Cuddapah district called <hi rend="italic">Chuḷiye</hi>, is referred to by Hiuen Tsiang. <hi rend="bold">Vijayālaya</hi> ‘the abode of Victory’ must have revived the fallen <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> line and taken Tanjore either directly from the <hi rend="bold">Pallavas</hi> or from their feudatories who were then occupying that part of the country.<note><hi rend="italic">Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. XII, p. 136, and Mr. K.V.Subrahmanya Aiyar's <hi rend="italic">Historical Sketches</hi>, pp. 207 ff.</note> His son <hi rend="bold">Ādityavarman</hi> conquered the Pallava king <hi rend="bold">Aparājita</hi> in battle and took possession of his country (vv. 47-49). This was the <hi rend="bold">Toṇḍaimaṇḍalam</hi> which <hi rend="bold">Āditya</hi> is known to have subdued.<note>See No. 89 above, and <hi rend="italic">Madras Epigraphical Report</hi> for 1906, Part II, paragraph 10</note> His son <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi> was a devotee of Śiva. He drove the Pāṇḍya king into the sea and carried his conquests even into <hi rend="bold">Siṁhaḷa</hi> (Ceylon) (vv. 50-52). This explains the titles <hi rend="bold">Madirai-koṇḍa</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Maduraiyum-Īḻamum-konḍa</hi> often found added to the name of <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi> in inscriptions. This <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi> is further stated to have built the golden hall called <hi rend="italic">dabhrasabhā</hi> (at Chidambaram) and thereby excelled <hi rend="bold">Kubēra</hi>, the friend of Śiva (v. 53). The larger Leyden plates, on the other hand, state that he only covered it with gold. His son <hi rend="bold">Rājāditya</hi> defeated king <hi rend="bold">Kṛishṇarāja</hi> in battle and went to heaven (v. 54). The reference here is evidently to the battle of <hi rend="bold">Takkōlam</hi><note>The battle of Takkōlam is referred to in the Ātekūr inscription; see <hi rend="italic">Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. VI, p. 50 f.</note> in which the Rāshṭrakūṭa king <hi rend="bold">Kṛishṇa</hi> III. and his Gaṅga feudatory <hi rend="bold">Būtuga</hi> jointly defeated and killed <hi rend="bold">Rājāditya</hi> who was fighting from the back of an elephant as stated in the Leyden grant. The summary way in which <hi rend="bold">Rājāditya</hi> has been disposed of by the author of the <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> plates shows that probably he did not succeed to the throne, although the Leyden plates explicitly state that after the death of <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka, Rājāditya</hi> “ruled” the kingdom.<note>The question of Rājāditya's succession will be discussed in detail in the general introduction to Vol. II,�</note> <hi rend="bold">Rājāditya's</hi> brother, <hi rend="bold">Gaṇḍarāditya</hi> next became king (v. 54). The Leyden plates say of him that he produced a son called <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> and founded a town after his own name on the northern bank of the river Kāvērī.<note>This village has been identified with the modern Kaṇḍarādittam in the Uḍaiyārpāḷaiyam taluk of the Trichinopoly district; see above, Vol. II. p. 374.</note> The next king mentioned is <hi rend="bold">Arindama</hi> (v. 55) whose exact relationship to <hi rend="bold">Gaṇḍarāditya</hi> is not specified. But it is known from the Leyden plates and from other inscriptions that <hi rend="bold">Arindama</hi> (<hi rend="bold">Ariñjaya, Ariñjiga</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Arikulakēsari</hi>) was the third son of <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi>. His rule was evidently neither famous nor long. From the <hi rend="bold">Mēlpāḍi</hi> inscription published at page 26f of this volume, we learn that <hi rend="bold">Rājārāja</hi> I. erected the Śiva temple called <hi rend="bold">Aṟiñjīśvara</hi> (the modern <hi rend="bold">Chōḷēśvara</hi>) as a <hi rend="italic">paḷḷippaḍai</hi> (tomb-shrine) to his grandfather <hi rend="bold">Ariñjaya</hi> who was also known as <hi rend="bold">Āṟṟūr-tuñjinadēva. Āṟṟūr</hi> where <hi rend="bold">Ariñjaya</hi> appears to have died must be distinct from <hi rend="bold">Toṇḍaimāṉ-Āṟṟūr</hi> where <hi rend="bold">Āditya</hi> I. is stated to have died (<hi rend="italic">Madras Epigraphical Report</hi> for 1907, page 71, paragraphs 29 and 30). Then came <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Chōḷa</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Chōḷa Parāntaka</hi> (II.) who was very famous. Five verses (56 to 60) are devoted to his praise. Of <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Chōḷa</hi> the Leyden plates state that at a place called <hi rend="bold">Chēvūra</hi> he fought a great battle and caused rivers of blood to flow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Chōḷa's</hi> son was <hi rend="bold">Aruṇmoḻivarma</hi> (vv. 61-63). After the death of <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Chōḷa</hi> (v. 64) his wife <hi rend="bold">Vāṉavaṉ-Mahādēvī</hi> is stated to have abandoned her people and followed her husband to heaven (vv. 65 and 66). His son <hi rend="bold">Āditya</hi> next ruled the earth, killed the Pāṇḍya king in battle and placed his head high. up as a pillar of victory in his capital (vv. 67 and 68). This Pāṇḍya king is stated in the Leyden plates to be <hi rend="bold">Vīra-Pāṇḍya</hi>. We also learn from the same plates that <hi rend="bold">Āditya</hi> II. had the other name <hi rend="bold">Karikāla</hi>. Immediately after the death of <hi rend="bold">Āditya, Aruṇmoḻivarmaṉ</hi> (called <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> in the Leyden grant) was requested by his subjects to succeed to the throne but he desired it not while his paternal uncle still coveted his dominions (v. 69). This statement which indicates a probable dispute about the succession to the throne immediately after <hi rend="bold">Āditya-Karikāla</hi> (II.) is not referred to in the Leyden plates. These latter state that <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi>, the son of <hi rend="bold">Gaṇḍarāditya</hi>, succeeded straightway after the death of <hi rend="bold">Āditya</hi>. Perhaps we have to give credence to the information furnished in the <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> plates and accept that while by right the succession was <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja's</hi>, he voluntarily permitted his uncle <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> to rule the kingdom, on the understanding that he would himself be chosen for the office of the heir-apparent (v. 70). <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> ruled the kingdom virtuously as a pious devotee of Śiva (v. 71). After <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka, Aruṇmoḻivarmaṉ</hi> was installed in the administration of the kingdom amidst the rejoicings of his people (v. 72). His <hi rend="italic">digvijaya</hi> or the conquest of the quarters and the <hi rend="italic">tulābhāra, i.e.</hi>, ‘weighing oneself against gold’ are mentioned in verses 74 and 75. The conquest of the quarters began with the south (v. 76). <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> conquered first the Pāṇḍya (king) <hi rend="bold">Amarabhujaṅga</hi> while his commandant (<hi rend="italic">daṇḍanātha</hi>) captured the impregnable fortress of <hi rend="bold">Viḷinda</hi> whose moat was the sea (vv. 78 and 79) The latter officer also crossed the ocean by ships and destroyed the lord of <hi rend="bold">Laṅkā</hi> (Ceylon) (v. 80). <hi rend="bold">Aruṇmoḻivarmaṉ's</hi> ocean-like army next defeated <hi rend="bold">Satyāśrya</hi> who fied away to avoid misery. “Being produced of Taila (<hi rend="italic">oil</hi>) this (<hi rend="italic">slipping away</hi>) was but natural in him” (v. 81) says the poet, thereby indicating that <hi rend="bold">Satyāśraya</hi> who was defeated by <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> was the son of <hi rend="bold">Taila</hi> II. He also killed the faultless Āndhra king <hi rend="bold">Bhīma</hi> for the mere reason that the latter had killed by a powerful club a certain <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi>, his namesake, who was an expert in war (v. 82). This statement makes it clear that <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> unnecessarily interfered in the politics of the Āndhra country, by killing a king called <hi rend="bold">Bhīma</hi>. This <hi rend="bold">Bhīma</hi> and the <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> killed by him have not been identified. <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> next conquered the <hi rend="bold">[Kēraḷa]</hi> country which was the creation of <hi rend="bold">Rāma</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Paraśurāma</hi>) and also subdued in battle successively the <hi rend="bold">Gaṅga, Kaliṅga, Vaṅga, Magadha, Āraṭṭa, Oḍḍa, Saurāshṭraka, Chāḷukya</hi>, and other kings (v. 84). This list of <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja's</hi> conquests, though by no means impossible, is yet exaggerated when it includes names like those of <hi rend="bold">Magadha</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Saurāshṭraka</hi>. According to the Leyden plates <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> I. was known by the title <hi rend="bold">Rājāśraya. Rājarāja's</hi> son was <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> (v. 85) who backed up by a powerful army turned his attention to the conquest of the quarters (<hi rend="italic">digvijaya</hi>) (v. 89). This king called <hi rend="bold">Uttama-Chōḷa</hi> (II.) started to the south as usual<note >Rājarāja's conquests as described above also commenced with his march to the south against the Pāṇḍya king.</note> with a desire to conquer the Pāṇḍya king (v. 90). The commander of his forces (<hi rend="italic">daṇḍanātha</hi>) so struck the Pāṇḍya that the latter ran away from the land of Agastya and sought refuge in the <hi rend="bold">Malaya</hi> hill (v. 91). After taking possession of many a pure lustrous pearl of the Pāṇḍya king (v. 92), <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> placed there his own son <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa-Pāṇḍya</hi> for the protection of the Pāṇḍya country and started westward (v. 93). For the first time in its history, <hi rend="bold">Kēraḷa</hi>, which was impregnable and unconquered, was entirely annihilated (vv. 94 to 97). The king after this returned to his capital and started afresh for the conquest of the north (v. 98), having again appointed his son <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa-Pāṇḍya</hi><note>Chōḷa-Pāṇḍya being only a title, it is difficult to understand if Rājēndra-Chōḷa Madhurāntaka appointed one and the same son for the protection of both the Pāṇḍya and the Kēraḷa countries or appointed two different sons.</note> to protect the western country (v. 99). <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> entered <hi rend="bold">Kāñchī</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Conjeeveram) in his march against <hi rend="bold">Jayasiṁha</hi> of the Taila family, the lord of the <hi rend="bold">Chāḷukyas</hi><note>Jayasiṁha is also called the king of the Raṭṭas since he was ruling the Raṭṭapāḍi, 7(1/2)-lakh province.</note> (vv. 99—100). He thoroughly routed him and his forces, thereby causing the ladies of the <hi rend="bold">Raṭṭa</hi> kingdom to shed tears<note>The Hoṭṭūr inscription of A.D. 1007-08 refers to the big Chōḷa army and its depredatory acts.</note> (vv. 101-107). <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> returned again to his capital (v. 108). With the idea of bringing the river <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgā</hi> into his own country through the strength of his arm he ordered his commander<note>An inscription (No. 333 of 1917) recently copied at Eṇṇāyiram in the South Arcot district (<hi rend="italic">vide Madras Epigraphical Report</hi> for 1918, p. 145f) states that Rājēndra-Chōḷa assumed the title Gaṅgaikoṇḍa- Chōḷa after defeating the kings of the north and receiving, (from them) the waters of the Ganges with all the pomp of a conqueror. This is not by itself enough to suggest that Rājēndra-Chōḷa personally conducted the northern campaign as suggested in the report.</note> to subdue the kings occupying the banks of that river (vv. 109-110). From v. 113 it is inferred that <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> also held the title <hi rend="bold">Vikrama-Chōḷa</hi>. The first king conquered was <hi rend="bold">Indraratha</hi> of the Lunar race (v. 114).; next, <hi rend="bold">Raṇaśūra</hi> was robbed of his prosperity and then <hi rend="bold">Dharmapāla</hi>. The commander of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> army reached the Gaṅgā and got the most sacred water of that river carried to his master <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> (vv. 116-117). Meantime <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra Chōḷa</hi> himself reached the river Gōdāvarī to meet his able General who had just brought the water of the Ganges, after having defeated <hi rend="bold">Mahīpāla</hi> on the way (vv. 118-119). Here, <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> is stated to have killed the wicked king of <hi rend="bold">Oḍḍa</hi> and to have accepted as tribute from the surviving claimant, many rutting elephants<note>The Mahēndragiri Tamil inscription, which bears the Chōḷa insignia of the tiger and the two fish and records the defeat of the Kulūta chief Vimalāditya by a General of Rājēndra-Chōḷa I., must be referred to this campaign of the king. Kulūta was mentioned as a country in the North-Ēastern division of India according to the topographical list of the <hi rend="italic">Bṛihatsamhitā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Indian Antiquary</hi>, Vol. XXII, p. 182).</note> (v. 120). His next compaign was against <hi rend="bold">Kaṭāha</hi> (v. 123). He then constructed in his capital the tank called <hi rend="bold">Chōḷagaṅgam</hi> which was composed of the waters of the Gaṅgā river, and established it there as a memorial pillar of his victory (v. 124). These conquests of <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> are mostly recorded in the historical introductions to his Tamil inscriptions dated from and after the 13th year of his reign.<note>See <hi rend="italic">e.g., Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. XI, pp. 230-231.</note> It may here be noted that the Tamil introduction given in lines 131 to 142 below is naturally the shorter one, since it belongs to the 6th year of the king's reign; and since it does not include a list of all the conquests mentioned above, it has been suggested that the Sanskrit portion of the grant which includes the conquests of the later years must be a subsequent addition.</p>						
                            
                            <p>Being encamped at <hi rend="bold">Muḍigoṇḍaśōḻapuram</hi>, king <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> deputed his minister <hi rend="bold">Jananātha</hi>, the son of <hi rend="bold">Rāma</hi>, in the 6th year of his reign, to grant the village of <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyūra</hi> to the temple of Śiva [at <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi>] (v. 125). This <hi rend="bold">Jananātha</hi> is stated to have been a minister of <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> and a crest jewel of the <hi rend="bold">Chāḷukyas</hi> (v. 127). The village <hi rend="bold">Purāṉagrāma</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyūra</hi> quoted above), which was granted to the god <hi rend="bold">Śiva</hi> named <hi rend="bold">Ammaiyappa</hi>, was the ornament of the province of <hi rend="bold">Jayaṅgoṇḍa-Chōḷa-maṇḍalam</hi> and was situated in the district <hi rend="bold">Pāśchātyagiri</hi><note><hi rend="italic">I.e.</hi>, the Tamil Mēṉmalai or Mēlmalai.</note> (vv. 128-129). It was also called <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi> and was bounded on three sides by <hi rend="bold">Siṁhaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi> and on the fourth by <hi rend="bold">Nityavinōda-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi> (vv. 130-131). The <hi rend="italic">śrīmukha</hi> or the royal order conveying the grant was written by <hi rend="bold">Uttamaśōḻa-Tamiḻadaraiyaṉ. Tirukkāḷatti Pichchaṉ</hi> made the request (<hi rend="italic">vijñapti</hi>) on behalf of the temple and <hi rend="bold">Araṉeṟi</hi>, son of <hi rend="bold">Māyāna</hi>, a native of <hi rend="bold">Maṅgalavāyil</hi> and of the fourth caste, did the business of taking round the female elephant (<hi rend="italic">kariṇībhramaṇa), etc</hi>., under orders of <hi rend="bold">Jananātha</hi> (vv. 132-135). The learned poet <hi rend="bold">Nārāyaṇa</hi>, son of <hi rend="bold">Śaṅkara</hi> and a devotee of Vishṇu, composed the grant (v. 136). <hi rend="bold">Tirukkāḷatti Pichchaṉ</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Araneri</hi>, sons of <hi rend="bold">Māyāna</hi>, do not appear in the Tamil portion of the grant described below. <hi rend="bold">Jananātha</hi> of the Sanskṛit portion is identical with <hi rend="bold">Narākkaṇ Mārāyaṉ Jananāthaṉ</hi> <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> <hi rend="bold">Rājēndraśōḻa-Brahmādhirājaṉ</hi> who together with three other officers of the king issued the order to execute the grant of <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> to the Śiva temple of <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu. Uttamaśōḻa-Tamiḻadaraiyaṉ</hi> is identical with <hi rend="bold">Nārāyaṇaṉ-kaṟṟaḷi</hi> <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> <hi rend="bold">Uttamaśōḻa-Tamiḻadaraiyaṉ</hi> mentioned in l. 276 of the Tamil portion.</p>						
                            
                            <p>The Tamil portion of the grant consists of 524 lines engraved on twenty-one copper-plates. The first 145 lines are actually taken up by the order issued under the authority of the king by his ministers and other officers. The next 281 lines contain a detailed description of the boundary line. The last 98 lines state the conditions and privileges with which the village was granted as a <hi rend="italic">dēvadāna</hi> to the temple and supply the names of the artisans who engraved the grant. The order was addressed to the headmen of the districts, the headmen of the <hi rend="italic">brahmadēya</hi> villages and the residents (<hi rend="italic">ūrār</hi>) of the <hi rend="italic">dēvadāna, paḷḷichchanda, kaṇimuṟṟūṭṭu, veṭṭippēṟu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aṟa-chchālābhōgam</hi> villages in <hi rend="bold">Mēṉmalai-Paḻaiyaṉūr-nāḍu</hi>, a subdivision of <hi rend="bold">Jayaṅgoṇḍaśōḻamaṇḍalam</hi>. This classification seems apparently to distinguish the revenue villages of the State from those granted to Brāhmaṇas, temples, <hi rend="bold">Jaina</hi> shrines, <hi rend="bold">Jaina</hi> teachers, and service-<hi rend="italic">inams</hi> and charitable feeding houses. The king being seated in his private room on the upper storey of his palace at <hi rend="bold">Muḍigoṇḍaśōḻapuram</hi> ordered that <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> in <hi rend="bold">Mēṉmalai Paḻaiyaṉūr-nāḍu</hi> which originally was a <hi rend="italic">brahmadēya</hi> of the assembly of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi> in <hi rend="bold">Naḍuviṉmalai Perumūr-nāḍu</hi> should from the 6th year and the 88th day of his reign, cease to be a <hi rend="italic">brahmadēya</hi> and be included under <hi rend="italic">veḷḷāṉ-vagai</hi> villages. He also ordered that in consequence the tax 598 <hi rend="italic">kaḻañju</hi> and one <hi rend="italic">kuṉṟi</hi> of gold which it was paying with <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi> must now be reduced but that unlike other <hi rend="italic">veḷḷāṉ-vagai</hi> villages, it must be made to pay as of old<note>Perhaps before it had become a <hi rend="italic">brahmadēya</hi> of the assembly of Śingaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam.</note> the permanent tax (in kind) of 3238 <hi rend="italic">kalam 7 kuṟuṇi</hi> and 5 <hi rend="italic">nāḻi</hi> of paddy together with 193 <hi rend="italic">kaḻañju, 1 mañjāḍi</hi> and 1 <hi rend="italic">mā</hi> of gold, including <hi rend="italic">paḷḷi</hi> and be given over as a <hi rend="italic">dēvadāna</hi> to the temple of <hi rend="bold">Mahādēva</hi> at <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi>.</p>						
                            
                            <p>Two executive (<foreign>karumamārāyum</foreign>) officers of the king and two arbitrating (<foreign>naṭuvirukkum</foreign>) officers passed the order that the royal writ may be entered in the account books just as it had been signed and issued by the four secretaries (<hi rend="italic">Ōlai-nāyakam</hi>) on the strength of a letter received from the officer who wrote the orders of the king, evidently under his direct dictation. This order was further supported by the approval and signature of three chief executive officers. Accordingly on the 90th day of the same year, two officers of the department of taxes (<foreign>puravuvaritiṇaikkaḷam</foreign>), and the officers called <foreign>varippottakam, mukaveṭṭi, varip pottaka-kaṇakku, variyiliṭu, paṭṭōlai </foreign> and <foreign>kīḻmukaveṭṭi</foreign> being present, the necessary entries were made in the registers.</p>						
                            
                            <p>Two other officers and a third, perhaps a non-official, were also appointed to superintend the ceremony of going round the granted village and its hamlets accompanied by a female elephant ( <foreign>piṭicūḻntu paṭākai naṭakkiṟatu</foreign> or in Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">kariṇībhramaṇa</hi>). In lines 128-145, we are told that the residents of the district who had also received a royal order to co-operate with the above said officers in walking round the hamlets accompanied by the female elephant, in planting boundary stones and milk-bush and in drawing up the gift deed, met together, went in advance to receive the royal order (<foreign>tirumukam</foreign>) placed it on their heads and making due obeisance to it, walked round the hamlets of <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi>. A short eulogy of the king in Tamil is here inserted in lines 131 to 142. The king is stated to have conquered with his great war-like army <hi rend="bold">Iḍaittuṟai-nāḍu, Vanavāsi</hi> of extensive forests, <hi rend="bold">Koḷḷippākkai</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Maṇṇaikkaḍakkam</hi>, to have captured the crowns of the king and queen of <hi rend="bold">Īḻam</hi> (Ceylon), the beautiful crown and other jewels which the Pāṇḍya king had deposited with the king of <hi rend="bold">Īḻam</hi> (Ceylon), the whole island of <hi rend="bold">Īḻamaṇḍalam</hi>, the crown and the garland of the Kēraḷa king and many ‘ancient islands’ in the sea. <hi rend="bold">Iḍaittuṟai-nāḍu</hi> which was for a long time identified with the country comprising the small taluk of Yeḍatore in Mysore, has now been satisfactorily proved by Dr. Fleet to be the Raichūr doab.<note><hi rend="italic">Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. XII, p. 296.</note> <hi rend="bold">Koḷḷippākkai</hi> has been identified by Mr. Lewis Rice with <hi rend="bold">Kulpak</hi> in the Nizam's Dominions.<note><hi rend="italic">Indian Antiquary</hi>, Vol. XLIV, p. 213 f.</note> It is not unlikely also that <hi rend="bold">Maṇṇaikkaḍakkam</hi> grouped with the two above names, may have to be identified with <hi rend="bold">Mānyakhēṭa</hi> (Māḷkhēḍ) in the Nizam's Dominions though hitherto it has been taken to be Maṇṇe in the Mysore State. <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa's</hi> seizure of the crowns of the Pāṇḍya, Ceylon and Kēraḷa kings must have earned for him the title <hi rend="bold">Muḍigoṇḍa Chōḷa</hi> which title he appears to have commemorated by founding the town called <hi rend="bold">Muḍigoṇḍachōḷapuram</hi>.<note><hi rend="italic">Muḍigoṇḍaśōḻaṉ</hi> was the name of one of the halls in the royal palace at Gaṅgaikoṇḍachōḻapuram; see above, Vol. II, p. 109.</note> </p>						
                            
                            <p>The circumambulation of the village by the officers and the district people, accompanied by the female elephant is detailed in the point-to-point description of the boundary line, which commences with l. 145. The eastern boundary touched the villages, <hi rend="bold">Perumūr,<note>This village is mentioned in Nos. 467 and 477 of the <hi rend="italic">Madras Epigraphical Collection for</hi> 1905.</note> Kūḷapāḍi, Nāraipāḍi, Maṅgalam</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Maṇaiyil</hi>, all of which are stated to have been hamlets of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi>.<note>Mentioned in No. 485 of 1905.</note> The southern boundary similarly touched the villages <hi rend="bold">Maṇṇālaiyamaṅgalam</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Toḻugūr</hi> which were also hamlets of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Kūṭṭukkumuṇḍūr</hi> which was a hamlet of <hi rend="bold">Nittavinōda-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi><note>Mentioned in No. 486 of 1905.</note> . Incidentally in the description of this boundary line, reference is made to the high road leading from <hi rend="bold">Tiruppāśūr</hi> to <hi rend="bold">Mērppāḍi</hi> <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> <hi rend="bold">Rājāśrayapuram</hi> which is of much interest, if by high-road (<foreign>peruvaḻi</foreign>) is meant, as at present, a broad and metalled avenue road used by men and wheeled traffic. The western boundary touched the villages of <hi rend="bold">Kīrainallūr, Śakkaranallūr,<note>Mentioned in No. 473 of 1905.</note> Kāraippākkam, Midugūr</hi><note>Perhaps same as Miduvūr which occurs in No. 456 of 1905.</note> —all hamlets of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Āṉaippākkam</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Mullaivāyil</hi>, hamlets of <hi rend="bold">Nittavinōdachaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi>. The northern boundary touched the villages of <hi rend="bold">Uppūr, Gaṅgaṉērippaṭṭu, Pōḷipākkam</hi><note>Mentioned in No. 455 of 1905.</note> and <hi rend="bold">Kayaṟpākkam</hi> which were also hamlets of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi>.</p>						
                            
                            <p>The inscription closes with a list of privileges (<hi rend="italic">parihāra</hi>) which, being a royal prerogative, were transferred from the king to the temple of <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍu</hi>, on the village <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> being converted into a <hi rend="italic">dēvadāna</hi>. The list consisted of several fees, taxes and tolls such as <hi rend="italic">nāḍāṭchi, ūrāṭchi, vaṭṭiṉāḻi, pidānāḻi, vaṇṇāra-pāṟai, kaṇṇālakkāṇam, kuśakkāṇam, iḍaipāṭṭam, tari-iṟai, taragu</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">taragu-pāṭṭam</hi>), <hi rend="italic">taṭṭār-pāṭṭam, maṉṟu-pāḍu, māviṟai, tīyeṟi, viṟpiḍi, vālamañjāḍi, nallāvu, nallerudu, nāḍukāval, ūḍupōkku, ilaikkūlam, nīrkūli, ulgu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ōḍakkūli</hi>. As I have stated elsewhere it is doubtful if all these terms have to be taken as referring to regular sources of revenue to the State or are to be considered mostly as obligatory services which the king alone could enforce on the people for his personal enjoyment. The list is not exhaustive. The Kāśākuḍi plates mention under <hi rend="italic">parihāras</hi> a larger number of items. There also it is stated that the palace resigned them in favour of the donee.<note><hi rend="italic">Above</hi>, Vol. II, p. 353, 1. 131.</note> The Leyden plates repeat almost all these terms under <hi rend="italic">parihāras</hi> but mention <hi rend="italic">tarippuḍavai</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">tari-iṟai</hi> and add the new term <hi rend="italic">āṭṭukkiṟai</hi>. The Vēlūrpāḷaiyam and the Taṇḍandōṭṭam plates published above add the terms <hi rend="italic">puṟavu-poṉ, tirumukkāṇam, taṭṭukkāyam, īḻampūṭchi, iḍaippūṭchi</hi> (perhaps same as <hi rend="italic">iḍaippāṭṭam</hi>), <hi rend="italic">kūlam</hi> (perhaps same as <hi rend="italic">ilaikkūlam</hi>), <hi rend="italic">pāṟaikkāṇam<note>This has been translated as tax on quarries. Possibly this term has to be connected with <hi rend="italic">raṇṇdra-pārai</hi> which occurs elsewhere. In this case it might mean only the fee levied on washermen's stones.</note> paṭṭinaśeri, ulaviyakkūli, ūreṭṭu, aṅgāḍikkūli,<note>See p. 222. above.</note> kaḍaiyaḍaikkay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uppu-kōrchchaigai</hi>. A set of <hi rend="italic">vyavasthās</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, conditions of grant) were also imposed on the donee. Here again the exact import of these conditions has not been properly understood. Some have taken it to be only permissive rights just like the privileges mentioned above, granted to the donee; but it would look apparently to be different when we see that permission to build houses of bricks, to dig wells, to plant coconut trees in rows, or to plant sweet-scented <hi rend="italic">verbina</hi>, may not generally have required a license. Still such are the conditions (<hi rend="italic">vyavasthā</hi>) mentioned <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, that mansions and large edifices shall be built of burnt bricks; wells and reservoirs shall be dug; coconut trees shall be planted in groves; <hi rend="italic">maruvu, damanagam, iruvēli, śeṇbagam</hi>, red-lilies, mango, jack, coconut, areca and such other trees shall be put in and planted; large oil-presses shall be set up and that toddydrawers shall not climb the coconut and palmyra trees within the boundaries of the granted village. One or two other <hi rend="italic">vyavasthas</hi> regarding the irrigation of lands also deserve to be noted. Usually the distribution of water for irrigation in each village appears to have been fixed by some common understanding. This allotted quantity of water, the grant states, shall be utilised by digging canals. Cultivators to whom the canal is not intended shall not cut open branch channels from it, nor bund up the water, nor raise it by small piccotas, nor bale it out by baskets; and those who have the right shall make the most economical use of the water without wasting it.<note>The phrase <foreign>ceṉṉīrp potuviṉai ceyyātatākavum aṉṉīraṭaittup pāccap peṟuvatākavum</foreign> has to be explained in the sense in which the same phrase occurs in a different form at p. 46 of <hi rend="italic">South-Indian Inscriptions</hi>, Vol. III. Here, <foreign>veṭṭi</foreign> corresponds to <foreign>potuviṉai</foreign> of our inscription and <foreign>punnīrviṭṭu pāccikkoḷvatākavum</foreign> to <foreign>aṉṉīr aṭaittuppāccappeṟuvatākavum</foreign>.</note> Canals flowing across other villages to irrigate the lands of this village and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> shall be permitted to flow over the boundary line and to cast up silt.<note><foreign>mēlnaṭainīrpāya</foreign> is a phrase which generally occurs in the description of the boundary line of a village when this cuts across a channel, the waste weir of a tank or a stream. Evidently it means that the boundary line which passes through the water is no probibition for the water from flowing over the line to irrigate other lands. The same is to be understood in the case of the casting up of silt.</note> Besides, the embankments of tanks shall be allowed to be raised within their limits, so that they may hold the maximum quantity of water.</p>						
                            
                            <p>The grant thus set forth was given effect to by the district people (<hi rend="italic">nāṭṭōm</hi>) of <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi>, an officer of the department of taxes and two others, one of whom according to l. 120 was an executive officer of the king. The same was also done by the assembly of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi>, represented by the <hi rend="italic">Karaṇattāṉ</hi> of that village; by the villagers (<hi rend="italic">ūrōm</hi>) of <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> and the assembly of <hi rend="bold">Nittavinōdachaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi>.</p>						
                            
                            <p>The grant was entered in the accounts in the 7th year and the 155th day of the king's reign, there being present on the occasion the officers already mentioned, together with some others. Four Sanskrit verses with which the inscription ends supply the names of the four sculptors of <hi rend="bold">Kāñchīpura</hi> who belonged to the Hōvya or Ōvī family, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Ārāvamurta</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Tamil <hi rend="bold">Ārāvamudu</hi>) his two brothers <hi rend="bold">Raṅga</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Dāmōdara</hi> and his son <hi rend="bold">Purushōttama</hi>.</p>						
                            
                            <p>There are three dates given in the Tamil portion of the inscription. The first which occurs in line 6 was the eighty-eighth day of the sixth year when perhaps the king orally ordered the release of <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> from being a <hi rend="italic">brahmadēya</hi> of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi>, its inclusion as a <hi rend="italic">veḷḷāṉ-vagai</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">dēvadāna</hi>, and its permanent settlement. The second date, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, the ninetieth day of the sixth year which occurs in line 62, was actually the day on which the written order was issued under the signature of the several officers of the king and was perhaps also entered in the books of the issuing office. The third date which occurs in line 517 and is one year and 65 days later than the second date was evidently the date on which the grant was executed and the necessary entries made in the account books of the villages concerned. The long delay in the execution of the king's order must have been due either to the complicated system of administration or to the details of procedure adopted in separating <hi rend="bold">Paḻaiyaṉūr</hi> from <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam</hi>.</p>

                <h4>TRANSLATION OF THE SANSKRIT TEXT.</h4>
                
                <p>(Verse 1.) May bashful <hi rend="bold">Bhavāni (Pārvati)</hi> who, seeing her (<hi rend="italic">own</hi>) form (<hi rend="italic">reflected</hi>) in the gem on the hood of the king of serpents (<hi rend="italic">which forms</hi>) the necklace of <hi rend="bold">Śrīkaṇṭha (Śiva)</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">and) (suspecting</hi>) it (<hi rend="italic">to be</hi>) another woman, looks askance, excited and jealous, at her husband who, with a heart all-desirous of (<hi rend="italic">her</hi>) embrace, prays (<hi rend="italic">for it</hi>) bowing at (<hi rend="italic">her</hi>) feet, grant you uninterrupted prosperity !</p>
                
                <p>(V. 2.) May that pond in which the royal swan of heroism sports; the sun (<hi rend="italic">which delights</hi>) the lotuses (<hi rend="italic">viz.,</hi>) the learned; the sole caravan-leader of the vast crowd of travellers on the two routes (<hi rend="italic">viz.,) (the temporal</hi>), where the results (<hi rend="italic">of actions</hi>) are seen, and (<hi rend="italic">the transcendental</hi>), where the results are not seen; the supreme ruler of all royal races; the ocean where the multitude of gems (<hi rend="italic">viz.,</hi>) all virtues, has its birth;—the Chōḷa family—rule for ever the circle of the earth, redressing the grievances of all !</p>
                
                <p>(V. 3.) The letters (<hi rend="italic">of the alphabet</hi>) limited in number are only fifty; (<hi rend="italic">whereas</hi>) the virtues of (<hi rend="italic">the kings of</hi>) the <hi rend="bold">Solar</hi> race are resplendent beyond number. How can I describe these (<hi rend="italic">virtues</hi>) with those (<hi rend="italic">letters) ?</hi> Oh ! Mother <hi rend="bold">Sarasvati !</hi> secure for me (<hi rend="italic">the help of</hi>) other letters (<hi rend="italic">lipi) (also)</hi><note n="413-1">The other letters (<hi rend="italic">lipi</hi>) which the poet wants to be disclosed to him may possibly here refer to some copper-plate inscriptions of Chōḷas which would give information about their early history.</note> .</p>
                
                <p>(V. 4.) The eye of the three worlds was the Sun<note>The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> introduces the Sun differently. First it mentions Vishṇu from whose navel sprang Brahmā; from Brahmā came Marīchī; from him Kāśyapa and Kāśyapa's son was the Sun.</note> from whom sprang the sprouts of all (<hi rend="italic">families of</hi>) kings. From him (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Sun) was born by concentration (<hi rend="italic">manana</hi>), Manu,<note n="413-3">The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> refers to the story of the calf that was run over by the car of Manu's son and to the spirit of public justice displayed by Manu by condemning his son to death on that account.</note> the first of kings whose name became (<hi rend="italic">thus</hi>) conformable to (<hi rend="italic">its</hi>) meaning.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 5.) Great <hi rend="bold">Ikshvāku</hi><note>According to the <hi rend="italic">Matsya-Purāṇa</hi>, this king had a set of 114 sons who were ruling the country south of Mēru and another set of 114 sons who were ruling the country north of that mountain; see H. H. Wilson's <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Purāṇa</hi>, p. 359, note 8.</note> was born (<hi rend="italic">as</hi>) his son; of him, in great battles the enemies of gods (<hi rend="italic">i.e., the dānavas</hi>) were greatly afraid. The three worlds, though completely immersed in the ocean of his spotless fame, (<hi rend="italic">still</hi>) enjoyed extreme delight.<note n="413-5">The <hi rend="italic">Virōdhābhāsa</hi> brought out in this verse deserves to be noted.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 6.) (<hi rend="italic">Then</hi>) came forth his son, the heroic <hi rend="bold">Vikukshi</hi>,<note n="413-6">Vikukshi is also called Śaśāda, “the hare-eater”, in the Purāṇas. The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> omits this name and makes Puraṁjaya, a son of Ikshvāku.</note> who was the husband of the youthful Earth adorned by the girdle (<hi rend="italic">viz.,</hi>) the waves of all (<hi rend="italic">surrounding</hi>) oceans, (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) whose lotus feet were resplendent by the lustre (<hi rend="italic">proceeding from</hi>) the diadems of many crowds of bowing kings.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 7.) To him was born as son the king named <hi rend="bold">Purañjaya</hi>, whose abundant prowess and heroism were well known and the expansive white parasol of whose blooming fame, having spread over the whole surface of the entire universe, was (<hi rend="italic">still found to be</hi>) in excess. </p>
                
                <p>(V. 8.) This mine of prowess, because (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) sat upon the hump of <hi rend="bold">Hari</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e., Indra</hi>) who had assumed the form of a bull, (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) killed in battle the warriors of the enemies of gods, bore on this account the name <hi rend="bold">Kakutstha</hi><note n="414-1">The same story is narrated in the <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Puṛāna</hi>. In the <hi rend="italic">Trētā</hi>-age there was a war between the <hi rend="italic">Dēvas</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Asuras</hi>. The former being vanquished at first sought the help of Puraṁjaya who completely annihilated the <hi rend="italic">Asuras</hi>. The relationship given here from Sun to Kakutstha is in agreement with the <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Purāṇa</hi>.</note> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, one who sits on the hump).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 9.) (<hi rend="italic">People</hi>) say that his son <hi rend="bold">Kakshīvat</hi> was a king of unopposed power, whose fame was sung by the celestial singers (<hi rend="italic">gandharva</hi>) in the houses of gods; and the light of the moon (<hi rend="italic">viz.,</hi>) the reflection of his spotless white parasol, extinguished the fatigue (<hi rend="italic">of the people</hi>) on the surface of (<hi rend="italic">this</hi>) earth.<note n="414-2"><hi rend="italic">I.e.</hi>, the people who were his subjects had no anxieties or, in other words, were enjoying perfect peace.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 10.) His son was <hi rend="bold">Aryyamā</hi>, the lord of the earth, who obtained the Lakshmī (<hi rend="italic">of victory</hi>) by stirring the ocean of his enemy (<hi rend="italic">forces</hi>) with the churning rod of his mountain (<hi rend="italic">-like</hi>) arm; (and) whose greatness was pre-eminently extolled.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 11.) In his family was born the king (<hi rend="italic">named</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Analapratāpa</hi>, whose magnanimity was well known in the world, and the fire of whose prowess sprang forth from his tree (<hi rend="italic">-like</hi>) shoulders<note n="414-3">Trees produce fire by rubbing against one another.</note> rubbing against the bow-string, and destroyed (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) enemies.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 12.) The full-moon (<hi rend="italic">in swelling</hi>) the ocean of his (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Analapratāpa's</hi>) family was <hi rend="bold">Vēna</hi>, the foremost of kings. His son was king <hi rend="bold">Pṛithu</hi>, whose prosperity was great, who was the chief of rulers, (and) who, like heroism incarnate for putting down injustice (<hi rend="italic">in this world</hi>), came forth (<hi rend="italic">clad</hi>) in mail, wearing a diadem of gems and holding a bow of matchless strength<note n="414-4">According to the <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Purāṇa</hi>, Pṛithu held the powerful bow of Mahādēva called Ajagava.</note> with the string (<hi rend="italic">drawn</hi>) and the arrow (<hi rend="italic">set</hi>) from <hi rend="bold">Vēna's</hi> right arm which was churned (<hi rend="italic">for that purpose</hi>) by chiefs of ascetics.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 14.) In this family was born a king who, having killed the demon <hi rend="bold">Dhundhu</hi> of enormous strength, (<hi rend="italic">bore</hi>) on earth the name <hi rend="bold">Dhundhumāra</hi>.<note n="414-5">According to the <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Purāṇa</hi>, Dhundhumāra was the title of Kuvalayāśva, who at the head of his 21,000 sons fought with the demon Dhundhu and defeated him.</note> This king also (<hi rend="italic">having become</hi>) the sole resort of virtues, ruled the whole earth.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 15.) In that family was born king <hi rend="bold">Yuvanāśva</hi><note n="414-6">According to the <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Purāṇa</hi>, he was the 8th in descent from Dhundhumāra and the second of that name in that family, the first being the great-grand-father of Kuvalayāśva Dhundhumāra.</note> who had no second (<hi rend="italic">to him</hi>) in austerity, celebrity, truth and (<hi rend="italic">other</hi>) good qualities; all people well understood his prowess to be a rampart-wall in protecting the whole world, ever increasing on all sides.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 16.) The son of that (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>), whose greatness was widespread (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) who was respected by (<hi rend="italic">those</hi>) who were (<hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>) deserving of respect, was <hi rend="bold">Māndhātṛi</hi>,<note>As here, the <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Purāṇa</hi> also makes him the son of Yuvanāśva. It states that he was born from the right side of his father who had drunk of water endowed with prolific efficacy, that he was nursed by Indra and that he ruled over the seven continental zones.</note> the master of courage, wisdom, love, prosperity and learning. (<hi rend="italic">He</hi>), the birth-place of mercy, ruled for a long time the earth as far as the <hi rend="bold">Lōkālōka</hi> mountain<note n="414-8">This is the name of the mountain which is supposed to be beyond the ocean of fresh water and beyond which again is the shell of the mundane egg; see H.H.

                <p>(V. 17.) Begotten (<hi rend="italic">of him</hi>) was his son (<hi rend="italic">known as</hi>) king <hi rend="bold">Muchukunda</hi>,<note>The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> mentions Muchukunda in the words <ta>“porutuṟaittalai pukuntu mucukuntaṉi maiyōr puramaṭaṅkalumōrāṇmai ceytuyarnta pukaḻum.”</ta> According to the Purāṇas, Purukutsa, Ambarīsha and Muchukunda were the three sons of Māndhātṛi born to his wife Bindumatī, the daughter of Śaśabindu. Muchukunda's long sleep and his burning of Kālayavana on waking up are mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu-Purāṇa</hi>, p. 566f.</note> who kept (<hi rend="italic">himself</hi>) awake in the duty of protecting the camp of the army of gods which was attacked by the forces of powerful demons; who was engrossed in the sleep obtained (<hi rend="italic">as boon</hi>) through the grace of the lord of gods (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Indra) and whose eyes, opening in anger, immediately consumed the crafty demon <hi rend="bold">Kālayavana</hi> and (<hi rend="italic">thus</hi>) pleased <hi rend="bold">Mukunda</hi> (Vishṇu).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 18.) In that family was also born he of immense prosperity who was a store-house of celebrated heroism, whose name was known (<hi rend="italic">to the world</hi>) as <hi rend="bold">Vaḷabha</hi>, who offered up (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) enemies as moths to the flames of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) arrows and founded (<hi rend="italic">the city of</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Vaḷabhī</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 19.) To him was born (<hi rend="italic">the king</hi>) named <hi rend="bold">Pṛithulāksha</hi>,<note n="415-2">The <hi rend="italic">Vīshṇu-Purāṇa</hi> mentions a prince Pṛithulāksha who was eighth in descent from Bali in the line of Aṅga.</note> who, at the request of crowds of gods and demons, set whirling in the ocean the huge mountain <hi rend="bold">Mandara</hi> for (<hi rend="italic">the purpose of</hi>) securing nectar.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 20.) To him was born a son (<hi rend="italic">known as</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Pārthivachūḍāmaṇi</hi>, who was a mine of power and who, while <hi rend="bold">Mukunda</hi> (Vishṇu) was giving the gods a drink of nectar, destroyed the army of the demons (<hi rend="italic">who were disturbing</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 21.) <hi rend="bold">Dīrghabāhu</hi>, the foremost of the virtuous and a jewel of that race, then became the paramount sovereign. Learned men say that the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> of his prowess <hi rend="italic">quenched</hi> the grievances of the virtuous.<note>Here the words ‘fire’ and ‘quenched’ printed in italics are intended to produce the <hi rend="italic">alaṁkāra</hi> known as <hi rend="italic">virōdhābhāsa</hi>.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 22.) He, king <hi rend="bold">Chandrajit</hi>, the parental home of the goddess of victory, conquered the unconquerable army of the enemies of gods and (<hi rend="italic">also</hi>) the Moon who had carried away the wife of his teacher <hi rend="bold">(Bṛihaspati)</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 23.) His son <hi rend="bold">Sāṁkṛiti</hi> became the emperor at the close of the Kṛita age. That he highly <hi rend="italic">reddened</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, pleased) the earth with the (<hi rend="italic">white</hi>) rays of the moon of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) fame is (<hi rend="italic">indeed</hi>) strange.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 24.) A jewel in that family was the king known as <hi rend="bold">Pañchapa</hi> the victorious, who, by the excellence of his body, surpassed the five-arrowed (Cupid) and vied (<hi rend="italic">in prosperity</hi>) with the lord of the heaven (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Indra).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 25.) In his family was (<hi rend="italic">born</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Satyavrata</hi><note>There was a Satyavrata in the Solar race who had married a Kēkaya princess, a descendant of Uśīnara.</note> who, being ordered by (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) father to protect the horse which was let loose for the horse-sacrifice, conquered, by (<hi rend="italic">virtue of his superior</hi>) strength, <hi rend="bold">Kāśirāja</hi>, the king of <hi rend="bold">Vāraṇāśī</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Benares).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 26.) (<hi rend="italic">Seeing that he</hi>) conquered <hi rend="bold">Rudra</hi> in a battle where a multitude of arrows proceeding from the bows of opposite parties struck (<hi rend="italic">one another</hi>) and produced flames, the assemblage of gods proclaimed “thou art <hi rend="bold">Rudrajit</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the conqueror of Rudra</hi>).”</p>
                
                <p>(V. 27.) The jewel of that prosperous family was king <hi rend="bold">Śibi</hi>,<note>He was one of the four sons of Uśīnara of the Lunar race. His descendants are called Śaibyas, from which the Tamil Śembiyaṉ may possibly have been derived. The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> refers to him in the words <ta>uṭalkalakkaṟavarintu tacaiyiṭṭavaṉu mōrorutulaip puṟavoṭokka niṟaipukkavavaṉum</ta>. It might be noted that in the <hi rend="italic">Mahābhārata</hi> (Vanaparvan, Ch. 132), the incident of the falcon and the pigeon is related in connection with king Uśīnara, the father of Śibi.</note> the son of <hi rend="bold">Uśīnara</hi>, who, out of compassion in protecting the pigeon which was threatened (<hi rend="italic">to be killed</hi>) by a falcon, gave up attachment for his own body. An ornament in his family was king <hi rend="bold">Marutta</hi>,<note>Marutta was a king of the Solar race, a son of Avikshit who had carried off the daughter of Viśāla, king of Vidiśa (<hi rend="italic">Mārkaṇḍēya-Purāṇa</hi>). In favour of Marutta his father is said to have abdicated the throne, being stung by the shame of his action. The Aitarēya and Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇas state that Marutta performed splendid <hi rend="italic">Rājasūya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aśvamēdha</hi> sacrifices using golden utensils and pleased Indra and the Brāhmaṇas, the former with the libations of Sōma juice and the latter with magnificent donations. Marutta, after crowning his son went to the forest where he was slain by Vapushmat. The murder was avenged by Marutta's son Narishyanta, who in his torn killed Vapushmat. The story of the performance of a grand sacrifice by Marutta is related in the <hi rend="italic">Mahābhārata</hi> (Āśvamēdhikaparvan, Ch. 10). Here also it is stated that Yudhishṭhira was advised by Vyāsa to perform his <hi rend="italic">Aśvamēdha</hi> sacrifice with the help of the gold left behind as balance by Marutta.</note> who was famous in (<hi rend="italic">this</hi>) world. With the riches that were used and left over (<hi rend="italic">as balance, after the performance</hi>) of his sacrifice, the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍavas</hi> performed (<hi rend="italic">their</hi>) sacrifice.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 28.) (<hi rend="italic">People</hi>) say that <hi rend="bold">Dushyanta</hi> was an ornament of the race of this (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>). His son was <hi rend="bold">Daushyanti</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, born of Dushyanta) <hi rend="bold">Bharata</hi>.<note>Dushyanta and his son Bharata are the lineal descendants of Pūru and well-known kings of the Lunar race. Dushyanta married Śakuntalā and the fourth in descent from his son Bharata was Sāṁkṛiti, whom our plates place so far high up in the list.</note> To him was born a son named <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> after whom the <hi rend="bold">Solar</hi> race on this earth became illustrious.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 29.) Him (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the king <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi>), learned men describe as the generous lord of gods (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Indra) who incarnated on earth (<hi rend="italic">on seeing that</hi>) the glory of his town (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Amarāvatī) was humbled by the varied and lustrous riches of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> country.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 30.) <hi rend="bold">Chōḷavarman's</hi> son was <hi rend="bold">Rājakēsarivarman</hi> (‘the lion among kings’) who split asunder with (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) nails (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, crooked knives) the elephants (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, his enemies) and (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) the cage (<hi rend="italic">wherein resided the goddess</hi>) of prosperity.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 31.) <hi rend="bold">Rājakēsarin's</hi><note>The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> refers to two Rājakēsarins, not a Rājakēsarin and a Parakēsarin as here and in the Leydon plates.</note> son was king <hi rend="bold">Parakēsarin</hi> by whose fire-like anger the enemies’ forces were consumed.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 32.) Thenceforward these two names indicative of (<hi rend="italic">their</hi>) suzerainty were alternately borne by the Chōḷa (<hi rend="italic">kings</hi>) in the order of their coronation.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 33.) <hi rend="bold">Parakēsarin's</hi> son was king <hi rend="bold">Chitraratha</hi>; his son (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Chitrāśva</hi>; to him (<hi rend="italic">was born</hi>) king <hi rend="bold">Chitradhanvan</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 34.) Heaps of wealth brought by kings from all quarters (<hi rend="italic">of the world</hi>) were poured out in front of him and by him in turn (<hi rend="italic">they were scattered</hi>) instantaneously (<hi rend="italic">before</hi>) supplicants.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 35.) Having come to know that king <hi rend="bold">Bhagīratha</hi> engrossed in penance brought down (<hi rend="italic">from heaven</hi>) the river of gods (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Gaṅgā) (<hi rend="italic">to earth</hi>), this king (<hi rend="italic">also</hi>) desirous of fame brought her (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Gaṅgā) to his dominions under the name <hi rend="bold">Kavērakanyakā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Kāvērī).<note>There is no finite verb in this verse. Either the usual <de>babhūva</de> has to be understood or <de>avatārayan</de> must be changed into <de>avātārayad</de> which would offend against the metre.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 36.) In that family was (<hi rend="italic">born</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Suraguru</hi><note>The Tamil poem <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> evidently refers to Suraguru and Mṛityujit as two different kings: Suraguru is first mentioned under the name Surādhirāja in the words “ <ta>curātirācaṉ mutalāka varu cōḻaṉumuṉāṭ cōḻamaṇṭala mamaitta piṟaku</ta> and then it seems to introduce Mṛityujit in the words <ta>‘kālaṉukkitu vaḻakkeṉa vuraittavavaṉum</ta>.</note> who was the hereditary abode of the maiden, the <hi rend="bold">Lakshmī</hi> of victory. This king having conquered by his glory the god of Death in his own territory<note>Evidently there was no premature death in his kingdom.</note> acquired the name <hi rend="bold">Mṛityujit</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 37.) In his race was born king <hi rend="bold">Chitrartha</hi> called <hi rend="bold">Vyāghrakētu</hi><note>The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> refers to him thus: <ta>puliyeṉakkoṭiyilintiraṉai vaittavavaṉum</ta> and mentions him not immediately after Mṛityujit but after a king who is stated to have conquered all the worlds (perhaps Viśvajit: <ta>puvaṉiyiṉ mēlaṉait tulaku mivvakilalōkamumelām veṉṟu koṇṭavaṉu</ta>) and himself to have succeeded the king who brought the river Kāvērī ( <ta>kāvirippuṉal koṇarntavavaṉum</ta>, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Chitradhanvan).</note> from his banner-cloth bearing (<hi rend="italic">the figure of</hi>) a tiger, who was a store of great heroism and who wore as an ornament on his head the flowers of the <hi rend="italic">dhātakī (Grislea Tomentosa</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 38.) The <hi rend="bold">Trēta</hi>-<hi rend="italic">age</hi> having come to a close, a son of this king known as <hi rend="bold">Narēndrapati</hi> became the ruler. The diadems of (<hi rend="italic">subordinate</hi>) kings dropped down their gems; (<hi rend="italic">because their</hi>) fastenings had become loosened by the constant rolling at his footstool.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 39.) From him was produced the head-jewel of the powerful <hi rend="bold">Solar</hi> race, (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Vasu</hi>, who was the cause of the destruction of the demons (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) who (<hi rend="italic">known</hi>) by the significant surname of <hi rend="bold">Uparichara</hi><note>This king, also called Uparichara-Vasu, was a member of the Lunar race and a descendant of Pūru. His story is given in the <hi rend="italic">Mahābhārata</hi> (Ādiparvan, Ch. 64), where it is specifically stated that he was presented by Indra with an aerial car made of crystal. The Tamil poem <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> evidently refers to this same king in the passage <ta>cuṭarmaṇittiraḷ vimāṉamatu vāṉmicaiyuyarttavavaṉum</ta>.</note> moved in any direction he liked in a celestial car which was presented (<hi rend="italic">to him</hi>) by the lord of gods (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Indra).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 40.) At the end of the <hi rend="bold">Dvāpara</hi> (<hi rend="italic">-age</hi>) was born in the family of this headjewel of kings a conqueror of all hostile kings named <hi rend="bold">Viśvajit</hi>.<note>See note above. According to the Purāṇas there was a Viśvajit in the line of Pūru, the fifth in descent from Ajamīḍha.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 41.) In his race was born <hi rend="bold">Perunatkiḷḷi</hi><note>The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> refers to him thus: <ta>taḷavaḻikkukaiyiṉil poḻipilattiṉ vaḻiyē taṉinaṭan turakartaṅkaḷ maṇi koṇṭavavaṉum</ta>. The order in which this king and the two others that follow are mentioned, is different in the Leyden grant and the Tamil poem; see <hi rend="italic">South-Indian Inscriptions</hi>, Vol. II., p. 377, and note 5.</note> who was the receptacle of all sciences, the abode of (<hi rend="italic">the goddess of</hi>) Prosperity, who was worshipped by the diadems of all the rulers of the earth which were set with rows of precious gems.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 42.) In this (<hi rend="italic">king's</hi>) family was born he, the leader of all the lords of the earth, the foremost of the great on account of his virtues, the king who renovated (<hi rend="italic">the town of</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Kāñchī</hi> with gold, who had established his glorious fame by constructing embankments of the <hi rend="bold">Kāvērī</hi><note>If the author of the Tiruvālaṅgādu plates meant the construction of the dam or anicut <hi rend="italic">across</hi> the Kāvērī, he would not have used the word <hi rend="italic">taṭa</hi>.</note> (<hi rend="italic">river</hi>) and whom (<hi rend="italic">people</hi>) called <hi rend="bold">Kalikāla</hi><note>In the Leyden grant and the <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> the form Kalikāla does not occur. In the latter he is described as the king who bestowed on the author of <hi rend="italic">Paṭṭiṉappālai</hi> 1,600,000 gold pieces as a reward for that composition. He is also stated to have defeated the Vaḻudi (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Pāṇḍya) and the Uthiya (Chēra) kings, to have destroyed Mukari in the course of his constructing the banks of the Kāvēri and to have conquered Kurumi.</note> because (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) was (<hi rend="italic">the god of</hi>) Death to the elephants (<hi rend="italic">kari) (of his enemies</hi>) as also to the Kali (<hi rend="italic">-age</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 43.) In the family of that (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) of extensive glory was born the emperor <hi rend="bold">Kōchcheṅgaṇṇāṉ</hi> who bore on his arm the earth (<hi rend="italic">extending</hi>) as far as the <hi rend="bold">Lōkālōka</hi> mountain,<note>See above, p. 414, note 8.</note> whose tremulous eyes were as blue as the petal of the blue lily (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) the bondage of (<hi rend="italic">whose</hi>) spider-body<note>This is a reference to the story of Kōchcheṅgaṇṇāṉ related in the <hi rend="italic">Periyapurāṇam</hi>.

                <p>(V. 44.) In the illustrious family of that (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) was born <hi rend="bold">Vijayālaya</hi> of praiseworthy prowess, whose footstool was battered by the diadems in the rush for precedence (<hi rend="italic">ahamahamikā</hi>) of kings desirous of prostrating.</p>

He, the light of the Solar race, took possession of (<hi rend="italic">the town)</hi><note>The form Tañchāpurī (in which Tañchā stands for Tañjā) appears to have continued down to the Vijayanagara times and we find in the introductory <hi rend="italic">praśasti</hi> of the kings of that dynasty that king Narasa, the father of Kṛishṇarāya, conquered the Taṁcha-rājya, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Tañja (Tanjore) country; <hi rend="italic">Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. IX, p. 340.</note> <hi rend="bold">Tañchāpurī</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Tanjore) which was picturesque to the sight, was as beautiful as <hi rend="bold">Aḷakā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the chief town of Kubēra</hi>), had reached the sky (<hi rend="italic">by its high turrets</hi>) and the white-wash of (<hi rend="italic">whose</hi>) mansions (<hi rend="italic">appeared like</hi>) the scented cosmetic (<hi rend="italic">applied to the body</hi>), just as he would seize (<hi rend="italic">by the hand</hi>) his own wife who has beautiful eyes, graceful curls, a cloth covering (<hi rend="italic">her body</hi>), and sandal paste as (<hi rend="italic">white as</hi>) lime, in order to sport with her.</p>

The earth having sought refuge under the shadow of his matchless white parasol did not experience on any occasion, the pain caused by the heat (<hi rend="italic">of misery)</hi>.<note>This word has to be taken metaphorically here to mean misery. The heat of the sun is not felt in the shade of an umbrella.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 49.) Having conquered in battle the Pallava (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Aparājita</hi> who possessed a brilliant army though (<hi rend="italic">he was in name) aparājita</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the unconquered) he (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Āditya) took possession of his (<hi rend="italic">i. e</hi>., Aparājita's) beloved country and thus fulfilled the object (<hi rend="italic">of his desire)</hi>.<note>The <hi rend="italic">Virōdhābhāsa-alaṁkāra</hi> is also hinted here; the <hi rend="italic">virōdha</hi> appears in his considering himself <hi rend="italic">kṛitī (virtuous</hi>) even after taking into his possession the enemy's wife (<hi rend="italic">dayitā</hi>).</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 50.) His son was <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the destroyer of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) enemies, whose name was full of meaning, who was a bee at the two lotus-feet of Purāntaka (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Śiva) and who was as (<hi rend="italic">it were</hi>) the embodiment of the boundless joy of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) subjects.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 51.) Encircled by the fire of whose prowess the Pāṇḍya king at once entered the sea, as if intent upon quenching that affliction in haste, abandoning (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) royal glory and (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) hereditary dominion.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 52.) The fire of whose anger after burning (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) enemies quenched not in the waters of the sea (<hi rend="italic">but</hi>) subsided (<hi rend="italic">only</hi>) by the tears of the wives of the <hi rend="bold">Simhaḷa</hi> (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) who was cut to pieces and killed by (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) weapons.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 53.) He built for <hi rend="bold">Purāri</hi> (Śiva), who was before (<hi rend="italic">this</hi>) on the silver mountain (Kailāsa), a golden house called <hi rend="bold">Dabhra-Sabhā</hi> and (<hi rend="italic">thus</hi>) put to shame his (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Śiva's) friend, the lord of wealth (Kubēra) by (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) immense riches.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 54.) His son <hi rend="bold">Rājāditya</hi> defeated <hi rend="bold">Kṛishṇarāja</hi> in battle and went to heaven. His brother named <hi rend="bold">Gaṇḍarāditya</hi>, whose feet were worshipped by the rows of diadems (<hi rend="italic">worn on the heads</hi>) of the rulers of the earth, became king.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 55.) <hi rend="bold"><note>Arindama's relation to Gaṇḍarāditya is not mentioned in the verse. But the Leyden grant clearly states that Rājāditya, Gaṇḍarāditya and Ariñjaya (or Arindama) were the three sons of Parāntaka.</note> Arindama</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e., the destroyer of enemies</hi>) bearing indeed a name which was full of meaning, became the best of kings; and dense forests became the abode of kings, who fled from his anger.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 56.) From him was born the king known as <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi> who received glowing prowess from the sun, profoundness from the ocean, great heroism from Hari (Vishṇu) the abode of strength, an incomparable body from <hi rend="bold">Kāma</hi> (Cupid), prosperity from Vishṇu and from the moon a splendour pleasant to the eye.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 57.) The mass of people believe this king to be Manu, who, out of love for the (<hi rend="italic">good</hi>) conduct which was set forth by himself, has come to the earth once again to establish his law which had become lax under the influence of the Kali (<hi rend="italic">age</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 58.) While that emperor <hi rend="bold">Sundara</hi> was ruling the circle of the earth, the syllable <hi rend="italic">hā(indicative of sorrow</hi>) was heard by people only in words like <hi rend="italic">hāra</hi>.<note><hi rend="italic">I.e.</hi>, the people had no occasion to experience sorrow.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 59.) This (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>), who was almost (<hi rend="italic">the god of</hi>) Death to the Kali (<hi rend="italic">age</hi>), considered the circle of the earth to be a more becoming jewel to (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) two serpent-(<hi rend="italic">like</hi>) shoulders than golden armlets brilliant with flawless stones (<hi rend="italic">gems</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 60.) The courtyard about the portals (<hi rend="italic">of his palace</hi>) was covered with the dust of gold-pieces which (<hi rend="italic">having</hi>) dropped down during the great confusion (<hi rend="italic">ensuing on the occasion</hi>) of (<hi rend="italic">the giving away of</hi>) unlimited charities, were crushed to powder by the hoofs of horses.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 61.) His son <hi rend="bold">Aruṇmoḻivarmā</hi><note>The form Aruṇmoḻivarmā, though correctly used, has to be read as Arumoḻivarmā in order to suit the metre. The literal meaning of Aruṇmoḻi (Aruḷmoḻi) is the ‘benevolent-torgued.’</note> was born (<hi rend="italic">like another</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Murāri</hi> (Vishṇu) supporting on his two arms, long like the <hi rend="italic">prāsa (weapon</hi>), the glorious (<hi rend="italic">goddess</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Śrī (Lakshmī)</hi> who closely embraced the whole of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) body, and bearing on the palms (<hi rend="italic">of his hands</hi>), the <hi rend="italic">śaṅkha</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chakra</hi> in the form of auspicious marks.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 62.) The eyes of people fully delighted in the extraordinary moon (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, his body) (<hi rend="italic">which maintained</hi>) great pure lustre in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the fortnights (<hi rend="italic">paksha</hi>) [<hi rend="italic">or</hi> was of pure descent on both sides (<hi rend="italic">maternally and paternally</hi>)] and presented a very big (<hi rend="italic">i.e., complete</hi>), orb (<hi rend="italic">always</hi>) [<hi rend="italic">or</hi> had an extensive kingdom to rule].</p>
                
                <p>(V. 63.) The <hi rend="bold">Nāga</hi>-women danced on the occasion of the birth of this emperor saying “this (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) in all probability shall relieve our husband (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Ādiśēsha</hi>) of the weight of the earth on his head.”</p>
                
                <p>(V. 64.) King <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Chōḷa</hi> of great prowess went to heaven, requested (<hi rend="italic">as it were</hi>) by the assemblage of gods to protect (<hi rend="italic">it</hi>) immediately from the attack of the armies of demons and demi-gods.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 65.) “I am determined to follow my lord <hi rend="bold">Sundara</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the beautiful) before (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) is coveted by the celestial damsels,” so saying zealously, his devoted queen the glorious <hi rend="bold">Vānavaṉmahādēvī</hi>, a very <hi rend="bold">Arundhatī</hi> in (<hi rend="italic">her</hi>) manifold good qualities, abandoned her own people<note>Here is a clear reference to <hi rend="italic">Satī</hi> performed by a Chōḷa queen. The special mention of the phrase ‘abandoning her own people’ in this verse agrees with one of the well-known rules of this ceremony in which the <hi rend="italic">Satī</hi> is requested by her people not to enter the fire which, however, she refuses; see <hi rend="italic">Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. VI., p. 218, v. 16f.</note> and followed him as [night] the day to heaven, afraid as it were of the allurement (<hi rend="italic">of her husband</hi>) by celestial nymphs and (<hi rend="italic">desirous consequently of</hi>) being near (<hi rend="italic">him</hi>) even there.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 67.) After him, his son named <hi rend="bold">Āditya</hi> ruled the earth. He, who excelled the mind-born (Cupid) in his (<hi rend="italic">superior</hi>) beauty, killed the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi> king in battle.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 68.) Having deposited in his (<hi rend="italic">capital</hi>) town the lofty pillar of victory (<hi rend="italic">viz.,</hi>) the head of the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi> king, <hi rend="bold">Āditya</hi> disappeared (<hi rend="italic">from this world</hi>) with a desire to see heaven.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 69.) (<hi rend="italic">Though</hi>) requested by the subjects (<hi rend="italic">to occupy the Chōḷa throne</hi>), in order to destroy the persistently blinding darkness of the powerful Kali (<hi rend="italic">age</hi>), <hi rend="bold">Aruṇmoḻivarman</hi> who understood the essence of royal conduct, desired not the kingdom for himself even in (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) mind, while his paternal uncle coveted his (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Aruṇmoḻivarman's) dominions.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 70.) Having ascertained by the marks (<hi rend="italic">on his body</hi>) that <hi rend="bold">Aruṇmoḻi</hi> was the lotus-eyed (Vishṇu) himself, the able protector of the three worlds that had incarnated (<hi rend="italic">on earth</hi>), <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> installed him in the office of heir-apparent, and (<hi rend="italic">himself</hi>) bore the burden of (<hi rend="italic">ruling</hi>) the earth.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 71.) Applying (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) mind to (<hi rend="italic">the devotion of</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Śarva</hi> (Śiva), utilising (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) wealth in the act of performing His worship, (<hi rend="italic">employing</hi>) all (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) retinue in the construction of houses (<hi rend="italic">i.e., temples</hi>) for Him, and directing (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) subjects to (<hi rend="italic">regularly</hi>) perform His festive processions, (<hi rend="italic">showing his</hi>) wrath (<hi rend="italic">only</hi>) in the killing of enemies and (<hi rend="italic">distributing his</hi>) riches among virtuous Brāhmaṇas, that king <hi rend="bold">(Madhurāntaka)</hi> bore on (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) broad shoulder, the (<hi rend="italic">weight of the</hi>) earth.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 72.) <hi rend="bold">Aruṇmoḻivarman</hi> was himself then<note>Perhaps we have to understand that Aruṇmoḻivarman was installed after the death of Madhurāntaka, though this is not specifically stated in the verse.</note> installed in the administration of the kingdom (<hi rend="italic">as if</hi>) to wash away the stain of the earth caused by the Kali (<hi rend="italic">-age</hi>) of his body (<hi rend="italic">bathed</hi> by the water <hi rend="italic">during the ceremony of installation</hi>); and the ends of the quarters heavily roared with the tumultuous sounds of the war-drums, rows of bells and bugles, kettle drums, tambourines and conches.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 73.) (<hi rend="italic">Surely</hi>) the milky ocean formed itself into a circle in the shape of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) white parasol in the sky and came to see his (<hi rend="italic">own</hi>) daughter Śrī (Lakshmī) resting on the chest of this (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 74.) Indeed ! the ladies of (<hi rend="italic">the lords of</hi>) the quarters, who were taken captives during the <hi rend="italic">digvijaya</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the conquest of the quarters), rendered (<hi rend="italic">their</hi>) service to this victorious monarch with chowries (<hi rend="italic">made</hi>) of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) fame, lustrous as the shining moon-beams.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 75.) Although, in the <hi rend="italic">tulābhāra (ceremony</hi>), the king was weighed against goldpieces in the scales (<hi rend="italic">tulā</hi>), he was still (<hi rend="italic">found) a-tula</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, unequalled). (<hi rend="italic">Hence</hi>), it is difficult to comprehend the greatness of the great.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 76.) This king—a pile of matchless prosperity, majesty, learning, strength of arm, prowess, heroism and courage—invaded and conquered in order, (<hi rend="italic">all</hi>) the quarters commencing with the direction of <hi rend="bold">Triśaṅku</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the south).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 77.) The moon as if to afford protection to the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi> king born in his own family, and thinking (<hi rend="italic">unto himself</hi>) “I am also a <hi rend="italic">rāja (king</hi>),” became the white parasol of this (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) who was intent upon conquering that (<hi rend="italic">southern</hi>) quarter.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 78.) (<hi rend="italic">King</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Amarabhujaṅga</hi> being seized, (<hi rend="italic">other</hi>) dissolute kings, whose rule was secretly mischievous, being much afraid of him at heart, wished to hide (<hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>) somewhere (<hi rend="italic">just like serpents with sliding crooked bodies</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 79.) The commandant of (<hi rend="italic">this</hi>) ornament of the Solar race, the hereditary home of (<hi rend="italic">the goddess of</hi>) victory, captured (<hi rend="italic">the town of</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Viḷinda</hi> whose moat was the sea, whose extensive ramparts were glorious and high (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) which was impregnable to the enemy warriors.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 80.) The lord of the <hi rend="bold">Rāghavas</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Rāma) constructing a bridge across the water of the ocean with (<hi rend="italic">the assistance of</hi>) able monkeys, killed with great difficulty the king of <hi rend="bold">Laṅkā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Rāvana) with sharp-edged arrows; (<hi rend="italic">but</hi>), this terrible General of that (<hi rend="italic">king</hi> Aruṇmoḻivarman) crossed the ocean by ships and burnt the Lord of Laṅkā (Ceylon). Hence <hi rend="bold">Rāma</hi> is (<hi rend="italic">surely</hi>) surpassed by this (Chōḷa General).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 81.) This is strange that though <hi rend="bold">Satyāśraya</hi> fled to avoid misery from the attack of his (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Aruṇmoḻivarman's) ocean-like army (<hi rend="italic">still</hi>) misery found a (<hi rend="italic">permanent</hi>) abode in him. But this is not strange, that his flight is due to (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, is <hi rend="italic">the result of his</hi>) birth from <hi rend="bold">Taila</hi>.<note><hi rend="italic">Taila</hi> also means oil and it is natural for a liquid to flow or run. Here the word <de>prabhāva</de> which suits the metre, appears to be used in the sense of <de>prabhava</de>.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 82.) “Since <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi>, an expert in war, of the (<hi rend="italic">same</hi>) name as myself, has been killed by a powerful club, I shall, therefore, kill that <hi rend="bold">Andhra</hi> (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) called <hi rend="bold">Bhīma</hi> though (<hi rend="italic">he may be</hi>) faultless.” So saying he <hi rend="bold">(Aruṇmoḻivarman)</hi> killed him (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Bhīma) with a mace.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 83.) Having conquered the country,—the creation of <hi rend="bold">Rāma</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Paraśurāma) whose beloved vow was to annihilate the whole of the Kshatra (<hi rend="italic">race),—(the country</hi>) which was adorned with pious people, was matchless and inaccessible on account of the mountains and the ocean, he caused abundant joy to all kings that held a bow (<hi rend="italic">in their hands), (and made</hi>) his commands shine on the rows of the diadems of all rulers of the earth.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 84.) Having subdued in battle the <hi rend="bold">Gaṅga, Kalinga, Vaṅga, Magadha, Āraṭṭa,<note>The name Āraṭṭa is not found in the Topographical list of the <hi rend="italic">Bṛihatsamhitā</hi>. In the later Vijayanagara inscriptions this name is mentioned side by side with Magadha among the countries that paid homage to the kings of that dynasty, and has been invariably translated as Raṭṭa; see <hi rend="italic">e.g., Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. IV, p. 270, and Vol. XI, p. 328.</note> Oḍḍa, Saurāshṭra, Chāḷukya</hi> and other kings, and having received homage from them, the glorious <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi>—a rising sun in opening the groups of lotuses, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, the faces of crowds of learned men, ruled the earth whose girdle is the water of all oceans.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 85.) To this ruler of men was born a son, <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi>, whose limbs bore all the (<hi rend="italic">distinguishing</hi>) marks of earth-rulers, who resembled a different <hi rend="bold">Manmatha</hi> (<hi rend="italic">mind-born</hi>) who had defied the angry roar of <hi rend="bold">Hara</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Śiva)</hi>.<note n="422-2">The <hi rend="italic">Paurantc</hi> Manmatha became the victim of the angry roar of Hara, being reduced to ashes by the fire of his third eye.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 86.) Wonder ! While he of great prowess, was protecting this earth ever following the ways of the good, the eyes of his wives openly transgressed the path (<hi rend="italic">laid down by</hi>) the <hi rend="italic">śruti (i.e., the Vēdas)</hi>.<note><hi rend="italic">I.e.</hi>, their big eyes extended beyond their ears (<hi rend="italic">śruti</hi>). Broad eyes are considered by the Indian poets as a mark of beauty.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 87.) The fierce Sun, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, the prowess of <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi>, stood pervading the whole space (<hi rend="italic">comprised</hi>) within the circuit of the quarters. It is strange that (<hi rend="italic">this Sun</hi>) reduced to ashes all the kings who stood aloof (<hi rend="italic">from him</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, those who were his enemies) but relieved the affliction of all kings who were near (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, those who sought refuge in him).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 88.) Strange it is that the disc of the moon (<hi rend="italic">rāja-maṇḍala, i.e.</hi>, the circle of kings) setting in the waters of the ocean of his sword, does not rise (<hi rend="italic">again</hi>). This is still more strange that (<hi rend="italic">subsequently</hi>) it (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the disc of the moon) continues to remain in the sky with (<hi rend="italic">its</hi>) brilliant lustre.<note>The purport of the stanza is that his enemy kings coming into contact with his sword do not rise again, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, they die. After death they remain in the sky with brilliant bodies of gods. The strangeness in the first instance consists in the fact that contrary to expectations the disc of the moon that <hi rend="italic">sets</hi> does not <hi rend="italic">rise</hi> again; it is still more strange that what does not even <hi rend="italic">rise</hi> shines brilliantly in the (<hi rend="italic">middle of the</hi>) sky.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 89.) (<hi rend="italic">This</hi>) famous (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) heroic lord of men intent upon doing meritorious deeds with large quantities of money acquired by (<hi rend="italic">the strength of</hi>) his own arm, turned his attention to the conquest of the quarters (<hi rend="italic">digvijaya</hi>), backed up by a powerful army.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 90.) Accordingly, he the unequalled king <hi rend="bold">Uttama-Chōḷa</hi> first started to the (<hi rend="italic">southern</hi>) quarter marked by (<hi rend="italic">the asterism</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Triśaṅku</hi>, with a desire to conquer the Pāṇḍya king, after having arranged for the protection of his own capital.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 91.) The commander of forces (<hi rend="italic">daṇḍanātha</hi>) of this crest-jewel of the <hi rend="bold">Solar</hi> race (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi>), struck the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi> king who had a powerful army. (<hi rend="italic">And</hi>) the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi> leaving his own country which was the residence of (<hi rend="italic">the sage</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Agastya</hi>, from fear (<hi rend="italic">of</hi> <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi>), sought refuge in the Malaya hill.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 92.) (<hi rend="italic">Then</hi>) the politic son of <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> took possession of the lustrous pure pearls which looked like the seeds (<hi rend="italic">out of which grew</hi>) the spotless fame of the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi> king.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 93.) Having placed there his own son, the glorious <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa-Pāṇḍya</hi>, for the protection of his (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya's</hi>) country, the light of the <hi rend="bold">Solar</hi> race started for the conquest of the western region.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 94.) Having heard of the humiliation which the rulers of the earth were subjected to by (<hi rend="italic">the sage</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Bhārgava</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Paraśurama) on the battlefield, (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) not being able to meet him (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Bhārgava) (<hi rend="italic">in battle</hi>) on earth, that proud king (Madhurāntaka) set his mind upon conquering the country called after him.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 95.) Excepting, <hi rend="bold">Paramēśvara</hi><note>The word also means the great lord. Perhaps Rājēndra-Chōḷa held the special title <hi rend="italic">Paramēśvara</hi>.</note> (<hi rend="italic">Śiva</hi>) who else in this (<hi rend="italic">world</hi>) could even contemplate in his mind to humiliate that country which is protected by the glory of <hi rend="bold">(Bhārgava)</hi> the crest-jewel of the <hi rend="bold">Bhṛigu-race</hi> and which since then (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the time of Bhārgava) has not been injured by enemies ?</p>
                
                <p>(V. 96.) <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> fearlessly crossed the <hi rend="bold">Sahya</hi> (<hi rend="italic">mountain) (and</hi>) immediately) attacked the lord of the <hi rend="bold">Kēraḷa</hi> (<hi rend="italic">country</hi>) together with his forces. Then a fierce battle took place which wrought ruin upon (<hi rend="italic">several</hi>) kings.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 97.) Having conquered the <hi rend="bold">Kēraḷa</hi> king and having annihilated the country protected by the austerities of the chief of the Bhṛigus, that prince, the abode of prosperity, turned towards his own capital (<hi rend="italic">which looked</hi>) as if (<hi rend="italic">it were</hi>) dancing (<hi rend="italic">in joy</hi>) with (<hi rend="italic">its upraised</hi>) hands, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, brilliant fluttering flag-cloths and whispering welcome by (<hi rend="italic">its</hi>) sweetly (<hi rend="italic">jingling</hi>) waist-belts of (<hi rend="italic">damsels</hi>) with unsteady eyes.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 98.) Then the great king, a light in the lineage of <hi rend="bold">Śibi</hi>, started for the conquest of the region of Vaiśravaṇa <hi rend="bold">(Kubēra)</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the North), of which the triple (ash-) mark (<hi rend="italic">on the forehead</hi>) is the silver mountain (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) where <hi rend="bold">Śiva</hi> is residing on the Kailāsa (<hi rend="italic">mountain</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 99.) Having appointed his own son the glorious <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa-Pāṇḍya</hi> to protect the western country, he the very god of Death (Kāla) to the Taila-family (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Western <hi rend="bold">Chāḷukyas</hi>) entered (<hi rend="italic">the town of</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Kāñchī</hi>, which was like the waist-band (<hi rend="italic">kāñchī</hi>) of the goddess-earth.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 100.) Observing that the lord of the <hi rend="bold">Chāḷukyas</hi>, king <hi rend="bold">Jayasiṁha</hi> was the seat of the (<hi rend="italic">sinful</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Kali</hi> (<hi rend="italic">-age</hi>), <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi>—himself the destroyer of the Kali-(<hi rend="italic">age</hi>)—started first to conquer him (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Jayasiṁha) alone.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 101.) It may be no wonder that the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> of his anger burst into a flame as it came into contact with the descendant of <hi rend="bold">Taila</hi>.<note><hi rend="italic">Taila-santati</hi> also means ‘quantity of oil.’</note> This is (<hi rend="italic">more</hi>) strange that it consumed the enemy-fuel, having crossed the great waters of the ocean.<note>This statement of Rājēndra-Chōḷa's anger crossing the oceans need not be taken in connection with the conquest of the Chāḷukyas between whom and the Chōḷa invaders there was no ocean intervening. The poet evidently had in his mind the oversea campaigns of Rājēndra-Chōḷa.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 102.) While this king with anger was engaged in vanquishing <hi rend="bold">Jayasiṁharāja</hi>, very strangely (<hi rend="italic">indeed</hi>), the fire of grief of the <hi rend="bold">Raṭṭa</hi> ladies burst into a flame, washed by the tears (<hi rend="italic">trickling</hi>) from (<hi rend="italic">their</hi>) eyes.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 103.) The sides of the ample breasts of the ladies of the <hi rend="bold">Raṭṭa</hi> king who was cut to pieces by his fierce General, (<hi rend="italic">though rendered</hi>) destitute of ornaments (<hi rend="italic">on account of their widowhood) (nevertheless</hi>) became brilliant and beautiful as before with shining pearls, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, the drops of their tears.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 104.) The forces of <hi rend="bold">Chōḷēndrasiṁha</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Jayasiṁha</hi> fought an intensive battle, each (<hi rend="italic">side</hi>) kindling the anger of the other, wherein the fire generated by the tusks of huge infuriated elephants dashing (<hi rend="italic">against each other</hi>), burnt all the banners.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 105.) That lord of <hi rend="bold">Raṭṭarāshṭra</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Jayasiṁha) in order to escape from the fire of the terrible rage of the ornament of the Solar race (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Rājēndra-Chōḷa) took to his heels with fear, abandoning all (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) family riches and reputation.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 106.) Afraid of the anger of the ornament of the <hi rend="bold">Vaḷabha</hi> race (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, of Rājēndra-Chōḷa) to whom fame was dear, the rest of the enemy's forces quickly sought refuge in forests and mountain-caves as did (<hi rend="italic">also</hi>) the dust (<hi rend="italic">raised by</hi>) his (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Rājēndra-Chōḷa's) (<hi rend="italic">pursuing</hi>) army.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 107.) The army of <hi rend="bold">Raṭṭarāja</hi> hemmed in on all sides by the continuous downpour of arrows, (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) beleaguered by the heroes in the army of the ornament of the <hi rend="bold">Solar</hi> race, was (<hi rend="italic">completely</hi>) destroyed just as a range of clouds tossed about by the force of furious winds.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 108.) Having defeated <hi rend="bold">Raṭṭarāja</hi> with (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) forces, the son of <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi>, well-versed in polity and attended by all his numerous virtues such as courage, prowess and victory, got (<hi rend="italic">back</hi>) to (<hi rend="italic">his) (capital</hi>) town.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 109.) This light of the Solar race, laughing at <hi rend="bold">Bhagīratha</hi> who had brought down the <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">to the earth from heaven</hi>) by the power of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) austerities, wished to sanctify his own country with the waters of the <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e., the river</hi> Ganges) <hi rend="italic">carried thither</hi> through the strength of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) arm.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 110.) Accordingly (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) ordered the commander of the army who had powerful battalions (<hi rend="italic">under his control</hi>), who was the resort of heroism (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) the foremost of diplomats,—to subdue the enemy kings occupying (<hi rend="italic">the country on</hi>) the banks of that (<hi rend="italic">river</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 111.) Before him, as from the slopes of the Himalayas, marched a very large army like the tremendous volume of the waters of the <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgā</hi> with wavy rows of moving horses, causing all the quarters to resound with its confused clamour.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 112.) The van of his army crossed the rivers by way of bridges formed by herds of elephants. The rest of the army (<hi rend="italic">crossed the same</hi>) on foot, (<hi rend="italic">because</hi>) the waters in the meantime had dried up being used by elephants, horses and men.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 113.) The soldiers of <hi rend="bold">Vikrama-Chōḷa</hi> having reached the points of the compass (<hi rend="italic">first</hi>) by the dust raised by crowds of elephants, horses and foot-men, quickly entered (<hi rend="italic">next</hi>) the country of hostile kings.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 114.) That general of the ornament of the <hi rend="bold">Solar</hi> race first conquered <hi rend="bold">Indraratha</hi> (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) captured the country of that jewel of the <hi rend="bold">Lunar</hi> race who met him (<hi rend="italic">on the battlefield</hi>) with very powerful elephants, horses and innumerable foot-soldiers.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 115.) The white parasol of that king, the jewel of the <hi rend="bold">Lunar</hi> race, fell (<hi rend="italic">to the ground</hi>) its (<hi rend="italic">supporting</hi>) staff and top being cut (<hi rend="italic">asunder</hi>) in battle by sharp arrows, as if the disc of the moon (<hi rend="italic">fell</hi>), distressed by the defeat (<hi rend="italic">of her descendant</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 116.) Then having robbed <hi rend="bold">Raṇaśūra</hi> of his prosperity he entered the extensive dominions of <hi rend="bold">Dharmapāla</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">And</hi>) conquering him too, this General of the king of <hi rend="bold">Śibis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, of <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi>) reached the celestial river (<hi rend="italic">Gaṅgā</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 117.) The (<hi rend="italic">daṇḍanāyaka</hi>) then immediately got the most sacred waters of that (<hi rend="italic">river</hi>) carried to his master <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> by the subjugated chiefs on the banks of that (<hi rend="bold">Gaṅgā</hi> <hi rend="italic">river</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 118.) (<hi rend="italic">Meantime</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> (<hi rend="italic">himself</hi>) with a desire to conquer (<hi rend="italic">enemy kings</hi>) reached the river <hi rend="bold">Gōdāvarī</hi> and by the scented cosmetics on his body (<hi rend="italic">washed away</hi>) during a playful bath in the waters (<hi rend="italic">of that river</hi>) caused her (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Gōdāvarī <hi rend="italic">river</hi>) to be suspected (<hi rend="italic">of enjoyment with a stranger</hi>) by the lord of rivers (<hi rend="italic">i.e., the ocean)</hi>.<note>This poetic idea of the lord of rivers suspecting Gōdāvarī must have been borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">Raghuvaṁśa</hi> where in Canto. IV, verse 45, Raghu is stated to have similarly caused the river Kāvērī to be suspected by the ocean.</note> </p>
                
                <p>(V. 119.) The powerful General had (<hi rend="italic">just then</hi>) got the waters of the <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgā</hi> carried to his master <hi rend="bold">(Rājēndra-Chōḷa)</hi>, after having defeated <hi rend="bold">Mahīpāla</hi> and having taken possession of his fame, splendour and precious gems.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 120.) The heroic king killed in battle (<hi rend="italic">the lord of</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Oḍḍa</hi> who was carrying on the orders of the king of the <hi rend="bold">Kali</hi> (<hi rend="italic">-age</hi>),<note><hi rend="italic">I.e.</hi>, who was following vicious ways.</note> together with (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) younger brother and (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) army and then forcibly took possession of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) rutting elephants.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 121.) There, the king with his own hand (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) from the (<hi rend="italic">back of the</hi>) elephant mounted by himself, killed a mad elephant that ran at him with its trunk raised.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 122.) He (<hi rend="italic">then</hi>) entered his own (<hi rend="italic">capital</hi>) town, which by its prosperity despised all the merits of the abode of the gods,—his lotus feet (<hi rend="italic">all along</hi>) being worshipped by the kings of high birth who had been subdued (<hi rend="italic">by him</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 123.) Having conquered <hi rend="bold">Kaṭāha</hi> with (<hi rend="italic">the help of</hi>) his valiant forces that had crossed the ocean, (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) having made all kings bow down (<hi rend="italic">before him</hi>) this (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) <hi rend="bold">(Rājēndra-Chōḷa)</hi> protected the whole earth for a long time.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 124.) (<hi rend="italic">This</hi>) lord constructed in his own dominions as a pillar of victory (<hi rend="italic">a tank</hi>) known by repute as <hi rend="bold">Chōḷagaṅgam</hi> which was composed of the waters of the Ganges.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 125.) This glorious and highly prosperous king <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi> staying in the town called śrī-<hi rend="bold">Muḍigoṇḍachōḷapura</hi>, deputed with pleasure the illustrious and virtuous <hi rend="bold">Jananātha</hi>, the son of <hi rend="bold">Rāma</hi>, in the sixth year (<hi rend="italic">of his reign), (ordering</hi>) him to have the prosperous village of <hi rend="bold">Paḻayūr</hi> granted to the enemy of (<hi rend="italic">the demon</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Andhaka</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e., Śiva</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 126.) Wise men call him (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Jananātha) who was the chief of the learned, a <hi rend="bold">Dhishaṇa</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Bṛihaspati</hi>) come down (<hi rend="italic">to the earth</hi>) from heaven in order to establish in the world once again the path of righteousness (<hi rend="italic">set up</hi>) by him (<hi rend="italic">before), (but</hi>) which was (<hi rend="italic">now</hi>) tottering under the force of the Kali (<hi rend="italic">-age</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 127.) He was the minister of the glorious (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntaka</hi>, as <hi rend="bold">Bṛihaspati</hi> (<hi rend="italic">is</hi>) of <hi rend="bold">Śakra</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Indra</hi>), the foremost of the learned who directed his intelligence to go always along the path of virtue, who was the crest-jewel of the <hi rend="bold">Chāḷukyas</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Chāḷukyachūḍāmaṇi</hi>), who (<hi rend="italic">like</hi>) the rising sun, caused the groups of the lotus (<hi rend="italic">-like</hi>) faces of all learned men to bloom (<hi rend="italic">with joy), (and</hi>) who was the storehouse of virtues and the birth-place of compassion.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 128.) That son of <hi rend="bold">Rāma</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Jananātha</hi>) gave this village to the god of gods <hi rend="bold">Śaṅkara</hi>, the enemy of the (<hi rend="italic">three</hi>) cities, known by name <hi rend="bold">Ammayyappa</hi> who had his abode in (<hi rend="italic">the village</hi>) called <hi rend="bold">Purāṇagrāma</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Paḻayaṉūr in Tamil) which was the ornament of <hi rend="bold">Jayaṅgoṇḍa-chōḷamaṇḍala</hi> and was situated within (<hi rend="italic">the district</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Pāśchātyagiri</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 130.) The village <hi rend="bold">Simhaḷāntaka-chaturvēdimaṅgala</hi> formed the boundary of that (<hi rend="italic">village</hi>) on the east, south and front.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 131.) (<hi rend="italic">The village</hi>) known as <hi rend="bold">Nityavinōda-chaturvēdimaṅgala</hi> was the boundary of (<hi rend="italic">this</hi>) village called <hi rend="bold">Tiruvālaṅgāḍ[u]</hi>, on its back-side (<hi rend="italic">i.e., west</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>(V. 132.) The royal order (<hi rend="italic">śrīmukha</hi>) was written by <hi rend="bold">Uttamachōḷa-Tamiḻadaraiya. Tirukkāḷatti Pichcha</hi> made the request (<hi rend="italic">vijñapti</hi>), in this (<hi rend="italic">grant</hi>). The wise and illustrious <hi rend="bold">Araṉēṟi</hi>, the son of <hi rend="bold">Māyāna</hi>, a full-moon (<hi rend="italic">in gladdening</hi>) the ocean, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, the village named Maṅgalavāyil, born of the fourth-caste (<hi rend="italic">chaturthānvaya</hi>), which was pure on either side (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, both on the paternal and the maternal), did, under orders of <hi rend="bold">Jananātha</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the rest of</hi>) the business, such as, the taking round of the female elephant (<hi rend="italic">kariṇī-bhramaṇa), etc</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 136.) The learned poet <hi rend="bold">Nārāyaṇa</hi>, son of <hi rend="bold">Śaṅkara</hi> (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) a devotee of the Enemy of (<hi rend="italic">the demon</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Mura</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Vishṇu), composed this grant.</p>
                
                <p>(V. 137.) May <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi> be victorious all over the earth, whose many gem (<hi rend="italic">-like</hi>) virtues step beyond the bounds of the egg of the three worlds; (<hi rend="italic">the number of</hi>) whose enemies is not sufficiently (<hi rend="italic">large</hi>) for the (<hi rend="italic">full</hi>) display of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) splendid heroism; who (<hi rend="italic">like</hi>) an ocean is the birth-place of all innumerable gem (<hi rend="italic">-like</hi>) virtues; for (<hi rend="italic">the grasp of</hi>) whose intelligence sciences (<hi rend="italic">as they now exist</hi>) are limited (<hi rend="italic">in number</hi>); who being solicited gives to the crowd of supplicants super-abundant wealth; and who is the birth-place of prosperity !</p>

As the term mostly occurs in subsidiary records coming immediately after the main record of a king either in one and the same inscription or in different inscriptions of one king grouped together on the same wall of a temple, it looks as if the term was meant to be one of high respect with which the king (once mentioned) was to be introduced.
