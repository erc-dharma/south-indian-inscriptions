						<p>These are two of the four sets of Pāṇḍya copper plate grants discovered so far and are herein published for the first time. The Vēḷvikuḍi grant of Parāntaka Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ has been edited by me in the <hi rend="italic">Epigraphia Indica</hi>, Vol. XVII, pp. 291 to 309 and the Madras Museum Plates of Jaṭilavarman, by the late Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya in the <hi rend="italic">Indian Antiquary</hi>, Vol. XXII, pp. 57 to 75. These four, studied together, furnish a genealogy of the Pāṇḍyas from the early king Kaḍuṅgōṉ, who is said to have flourished at the close of the first Śaṅgam of Tamiḻ poets, down to Rājasiṁha-Pāṇḍya<note n="441-1">See below, Table, on p. 446. The three Pāṇḍya kings Perumbiḍugu Muttaraiyaṉ <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Kuvāvaṉ Māṟaṉ, his son Iḷaṅgōvadiyaraiyaṉ <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Māṟaṉ Paramēśvaraṉ, and his son Pērumbiḍugu Muttaraiyaṉ <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Śuvaraṉ Māṟaṉ mentioned in the Śendalai pillar inscriptions of about the 8th century A.D. do not appear in this genealogy. They evidently belonged to a subordinate branch of the family and were perhaps kings of the southern Tañjai country, ruling almost independently of the imperial Pāṇḍyas at Madura and sometimes fighting with them. See <hi rend="italic">Ep. Ind</hi>., Vol. XIII, pp. 136 and 137.</note> , the contemporary of the Chōḷa king Parāntaka I, who reigned at the commencement of the 10th century A.D. With the invasion of the latter into the Pāṇḍya country and his capture of Madura, which earned for him the title ‘Madiraikoṇḍa’, the early Pāṇḍya power seems to have come to an end, and made room, for the next two centuries at least, for the unchallenged sway of the Chōḷas over the whole of Southern India.</p>						

						<p>The two grants under consideration have been thoroughly reported in the <hi rend="italic">Annual Report on Epigraphy</hi> for 1906-1907, pp. 62 ff. Speaking of their provenance, Mr. Venkayya states “the plates are reported to have been found about 20 or 25 years ago (now nearly forty years) while digging for the foundation of the kitchen in the Vishṇu temple at Śiṉṉamaṉūr<note n="441-2">Spelt Chinnamanur in the Alphabetical list of villages in the Madras Presidency.</note> in the Periyakuḷam taluka of the Madura district, and have since been purchased for deposit in the Madras Museum, from their owner Mr. Rajam Ayyar.”</p>						

						<p>The bigger of the two sets consists of seven copper plates, measuring approximately 10" by 3(3/8)". The thin rims which they once seem to have had, are now completely worn out. The plates are numbered on their obverse sides, with the Tamiḻ numerals 2 to 8 close to the right side of the ring hole, thus showing that the first plate, whose obverse must have borne the number 1, is now lost. The last plate ending with the word <hi rend="italic">Kaṟkuḷattil</hi>, also shows that one or more plates which contained the last portion of the grant are lost. The ring which held the plates together and which, judging by the size of the ring holes in the middle of the left margin of each plate, must have been a little less than 3/8" in thickness, is missing. The existing seven plates weigh 390 <hi rend="italic">tolas</hi>.</p>						

						<p>The smaller set consists of three thin plates without rims, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the first, second and the last, with one or more plates of two written sides, missing between the second and the last. The first and the last plates are not numbered as in the larger set. The ring with which the plates were held together is lost. The ring-hole is not, as usual, bored in the middle of the left margin, but at the left bottom or the left top corner, according as the written side of the plate is odd or even—the sheets being meant evidently to be read by turning over the leaf, as in a palm-leaf manuscript without the necessity of actually removing the plate from the ring. The plates measure 8(11/12)" by 3" and the three plates, together, weigh 51 <hi rend="italic">tolas</hi>.</p>						

						<p>Both sets of plates use the Grantha alphabet wherever Sanskrit verses and Sanskrit words occur and the Tamiḻ Vaṭṭeḻuttu where the Tamiḻ language is employed. The palaeography of the smaller set of plates does not differ much from that of the Madras Musuem plates of Parāntaka Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ, who, as I have stated already in my paper on the Vēḷvikuḍi grant, has to be identified with the donor of the latter and therefore also with Māṟajañjaḍaiyaṉ of the Āṉaimalai inscription.<note n="442-1"><hi rend="italic">Ep. Ind</hi>., Vol. VIII, p. 317 f.</note> </p>						

						<p>The remark made by Mr. Venkayya that the Madras Museum plates and the smaller Siṉṉamaṉūr plates are nearer in point of time to the larger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates than they are to the Vēḷvikuḍi grant, has been already examined by me in the light of the palaeography of the plates under publication. I have noticed that the difference in the formation of the Grantha characters of the Vēḷvikuḍi, the Madras Museum and the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates all of which in my opinion belong to the same period, should be due to their having been written at different periods later than their Vaṭṭeḻuttu portions. In the matter of their Vaṭṭeḻuttu writing, the smaller and the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates are far separated by time and the palaeographical differences are apparent. The formation of the initial vowel <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">e</hi>mark in consonants, the letters <hi rend="italic">na, ma</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">ya</hi>,—of which the two latter, it is surprising to find, resemble the <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> of the Vēḷvikuḍi and the Āṉaimalai inscriptions,—show marked differences. The differences which the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates and the Madras Museum plates present, except in the formation of the letter <hi rend="italic">ya</hi>, are very slight. They are almost nil. Consequently, Mr. Venkayya's identification of the second king Arikēsari Asamasaman Māṟavarman mentioned in the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates with Māṟavarman Pallavabhañjana of the Madras Museum plates and that of his son—his unnamed son who was victorious at Marudūr—with Jaṭilavarman Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ of the same plates, becomes untenable even on the grounds of palaeography. This point will become clearer in the sequel where the identification of the kings mentioned in the smaller and the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates is discussed.</p>						

						<p>The Sanskrit portion of the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates begins with a fragmentary verse in which the king (perhaps Pāṇḍya) boasts of having subdued the ocean—an attribute which the mythical Pāṇḍya kings generally assumed in consequence, perhaps, of their sea-bordering kingdom, their naval power, and their sea-borne trade, from the earliest historical times. From him were descended the kings known as Pāṇḍyas (v. 2) ‘who engraved their edicts on the Himalaya mountain’ and whose family-priest was the sage Agastya (v. 3). One of the Pāṇḍya kings is said to have occupied the throne of Indra (v. 4) and another to have shared it with that god, and still another, to have caused the Ten-Headed (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Rāvaṇa of Laṅkā) to sue for peace (v. 5). One was a conqueror of the epic hero Arjuna (v. 7)<note n="442-2">See <hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XXII, p. 59 and foot-note 4.</note> . Verse 8 refers to a king who cut off his own head in order to protect that of his master and also to a certain Sundara-Pāṇḍya who had mastered all the sciences. Many kings of this family had performed Vēdic sacrifices <hi rend="italic">Rājasūya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aśvamēdha</hi> (v. 9).<note n="442-3">The Tamiḻ portion gives many more of such attributes to the Pāṇḍya ancestors; see below p. 443.</note> </p>						

						<p>In this family was born king Arikēsarin. His son was Jaṭila; his son Rājasiṁha (II); his son Varaguṇa (I); and his son Śrī-Māṟa entitled Śrīvallabha (v. 10). Śrī-Māṟa conquered Māyā-Pāṇḍya, the kings of Kēraḷa and Siṁhaḷa, the Pallava and the Vallabha (v. 11). His son was Parāntaka the younger brother of Varaguṇa II (v. 12), who fought a battle at Kharagiri and captured Ugra (v. 13). His wife was Vāṉavaṉmahādēvī (v. 15) and their son was Rājasiṁha (III), the banner (both) of the solar and the lunar races (vv. 16 and 17).</p>						

						<p>A favourite of this king was the Brāhman Parāntaka, the son of Śrēshṭhiśarman, the grandson of the Vēdic scholar Bhāskara (v. 21) and the great-grandson of Śrēshṭhin, a Seṅguṭi-Kauśika of Puttūr (vv. 20 and 21). The ancestors of this Parāntaka were the followers of Āgnivēśya-kalpa—evidently the science of medicine—and his maternal grandfather was the famous Ūraśarman of the Maudgalya lineage, of Syandanagrāma. To Śrēshṭhiśarman, king Parāntaka Vīranārayaṇa had given the village of Maṇiyāchi, surnamed Tiśaichchuḍarmaṅgala in Vaḍa-Kaḷavaḻi-nāḍu. The ruling king Rājasiṁha (III) gave to the Brāhman Parāntaka. In the 16th year of his reign, while encamped at Chūḻal in Rājasiṁha-kuḷakkiḻ, the <hi rend="italic">agrahāra</hi> Naṟcheygai-Puttūr surnamed Mandaragauravamaṅgalam in Aḷa-nāḍu.</p>						

						<p>The <hi rend="italic">vijñapti</hi> of the grant was the councillor and poet Jaṭila (v. 33) of the Atri-gōtra, while the <hi rend="italic">ājñapti</hi> was Kūṟṟaṅgōṉ, a servant of king Māṟavarman (v. 34). The <hi rend="italic">kuḍikāval</hi> was Nakkaṅkumāṉ, son of the headman of Kūra in Kīḻ-Vēmba-nāḍu, who was a minister and the chief of the elephant forces. Nakkaṅ-Kāḍa, Kōṉ-Vēḷāṉ and Paṭārañ-Chōlai were three officers who witnessed the demarcation of the boundary line. Verse 37 supplies for the king the surname Abhimānamēru.</p>						

						<p>The composer of the <hi rend="italic">praśasti</hi> was Vāsudēva, a friend of Madhuraguṇa and the elder brother of Vishṇu (v. 38).</p>						

						<p>The Tamil portion which begins with line 76 also praises the Pāṇḍya kings who belonged to the lunar race and bore the crest of the double fish, had Agastya as their family preceptor and counted the god (Śiva) as one of their family members. Many other incidents, mostly mythical, are also registered of some of the early kings: such as, (1) churning the ocean for nectar; (2) bathing in the waters of the four oceans in a single day; (3) going round the earth; (4) sending embassy to the gods on many occasions; (5) taking away the necklace of Pākaśāsana (Indra); (6) mastering the Tamiḻ language of the south; (7) driving away the sea by throwing a javelin; (8) giving a thousand golden hills (<hi rend="italic">Mēru</hi>) in charity; (9) founding the town of Madura and erecting a wall round it; (10) studying Tamiḻ and Sanskrit (<hi rend="italic">vaḍa-moḻi</hi>) as even to excel Paṇḍits; (11) leading elephants in the Bhārata war against the Mahārathas; (12) relieving Vijaya (Arjuna) from the curse of Vasu; (13) engraving the victorious symbols of the fish, the tiger, and the bow on the top of the Northern mountain, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Himalayas; (14) getting huge giants to work for them in building many tanks; (15) cutting off the heads of two kings in the battles fought at Chitramayari and Talaiyālaṅgāṉam; (16) getting the Mahābhārata translated into Tamiḻ; and (17) establishing the Tamiḻ Śaṅgam in the town of Madura. After these kings had passed away, there came a king named Parāṅkuśa who saw the back of (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, defeated) the Chēra king at Nelvēli and the Pallava king at Śaṅkaramaṅgai. His grandson was Rājasiṁha, after whom came a king named Varaguṇa-Mahārāja. The exact relationship of this Varaguṇa-Mahārāja to his predecessor Rājasiṁha has not been recorded. Rājasiṁha's son was Parachakrakōlāhala who was successful in battles fought at Kuṇṇūr, Śiṅgaḷam (Ceylon) and Viḻiñam and who at Kuḍamūkkil won a deadly battle against the combined armies of the Gaṅga, Pallava, Chōḷa, Kaliṅga, Magadha and other kings. Next came Varaguṇavarman, whose relationship to Parachakrakōlāhala is also not specified. His younger brother was Parāntakaṉ Śaḍaiyaṉ, who fought battles at Śennilam, Kharagiri and Peṇṇāgaḍam in the Koṅgu country. To him and his queen Vāṉavaṉmahādēvī was born Rājasiṁha surnamed Vikaṭavāḍava and Mandaragaurava. This latter fought a battle at Ulappinimaṅgalam, drove the king of Tañjai (Tanjore) in a battle fought at Naippūr, won a battle at Koḍumbai, burnt the town of Vañji on the northern bank of the Poṉṉi (Kāvērī) river and destroyed the lord of the southern Tañjai country at Nāval.</p>						

						<p>In the 14th year opposite to the second year of his reign (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the 16th year as stated in the Sanskrit portion), this Rājasiṁha, while he was encamped at Chūḻal, a town founded by himself in the district of Rājaśiṅgapperuṅguḷakkīḻ or Rājasiṁhakuḷakkīḻ, granted to the Brāhman Parāntaka, the village Naṟcheygai-Puttūr in Aḷa-nāḍu, re-naming it Mandaragauravaṁaṅgalam. As in the Sanskrit portion, lines 147 to 155 seem to record that Bhāskaran-Śeṭṭi (Śrēshṭhiśarman of the Sanskrit portion) the son of Bhāskara and the foremost of the Ombāḻvas of the Āgnivēśya-kalpa and the Komara-Kauśika-gōtra (Śeṅguṭi-Kauśika of the Sanskrit portion) dwelling in Puttūr, in the Mīyguṇḍāṟu (district) of Koḻuvūr-kūṟṟam (division), had received from Parāntaka Vīranārāyaṇa, the village of Tiśaichchuḍarmaṅgalam in the Vaḍakaḷavaḻi-nāḍu (province). From the Sanskrit passage, we learn that Maṇiyāchi, which may be identified with the well-known junction station on the South Indian Railway, was surnamed Tiśaichchuḍarmaṅgalam. The <hi rend="italic">viṇṇappam</hi> (<hi rend="italic">vijñapti</hi> in Sanskrit) <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the one who made the formal request to the king, was, according to the Tamiḻ portion, a certain Śaḍaiyapirāṉ-Bhaṭṭasōmayājin of Pullamaṅgalam in Śōḻa-nāḍu: and the <hi rend="italic">ājñapti</hi>, as in the Śanskrit portion, was Kūṟṟaṅgōṉ, a native of Vēmbaṟṟūr in Kaḷavaḻināḍu. Kumāṉ or Nakkan-Kumāṉ<note n="444-1">Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa, Uttarakāṇḍa, chapter 34.</note> (as he is called in Sanskrit) of the village of Kūra in Kīḻ-Vēmba-nāḍu, was the <hi rend="italic">kuḍikāval-nāyakaṉ</hi> or the chief revenue officer. The three officers, who, according to the Sanskrit portion, were to witness the demarcation of the boundary line, are stated in the Tamiḻ portion, to have been the <hi rend="italic">kaṇakkar</hi> or accountants, the demarcation itself being done by the <hi rend="italic">nāṭṭār, i.e.</hi>, the district people of Aḷa-nāḍu. Of the boundaries, the eastern boundary was the Śuruḷi-āṟu (river). The southern boundary of the village granted, which commences at the end of the eighth plate, must have been continued on the next, which is however missing.</p>						

						<p>Compared with the Vēḷvikuḍi plates of Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ, we find that the account given in the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates includes, as it should, many later Pāṇḍya kings. The mild Purāṇic tradition of the Vēḷvikuḍi plates connecting the Pāṇḍyas with Agastya, the churning of the milk ocean, and the sharing with Indra of half his throne and necklace, grows here into a big list with seven or eight other extra items added to it. Some of these are interesting. For instance, the going round the earth, and the bathing in the waters of the four oceans in a single day, are feats attributed to Vāli, king of the monkeys<note type="repeated" n="444-1"/>. Again, calling the aid of huge giants to build tanks in the Pāṇḍya land also seems to suggest the near connection which the Pāṇḍya country had with Ceylon, the land of Rāvaṇa. The driving away of the sea by throwing a javelin is perhaps a reminiscence of a similar feat ascribed to the epic hero Rāma. The leading of elephants against the Mahārathas in the Bhārata war is a fact which is commemorated also in literature, of the Chēra king Śeṅguṭṭuvaṉ, who is said to have fed the soldiers in the Mahābhārata war. Some of the other attributes, however, are of much historical value. The mastery over the Tamiḻ language of the south, the foundation of the town of Madura and the erection of a wall round it, the studying of Tamiḻ and Sanskrit as even to excel Paṇḍits, the initiating of the translation of the Mahābhārata into Tamiḻ and the establishing of the Tamiḻ Śaṅgam (academy) in the town of Madura— these, clearly indicate the close connection the Pāṇḍya kings had with the development of the Tamiḻ language and the foundation of the town of Madura. The battles of Chitramuyari and Talaiyālaṅgāṉam mentioned of one of the unnamed Pāṇḍya kings must be a reference to Neḍuñjeḻiyaṉ who is spoken of in literature as the hero who gained success in the battle of Talaiyalāṅgāṉam by defeating the Chōḷa and the Chēra kings. Our plates add that the heads of these two kings were actually cut off and this was not in one battle as literature suggests, but in two, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, Chitramuyari and Talaiyālaṅgāṉam.<note n="445-1">For further information on the Pāṇḍya who fought the battle of Talaiyālaṅgānam, <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Dr. S.K. Ayyangar's <hi rend="italic">Beginnings of South Indian History</hi>, chapter 4.</note> </p>						

						<p>The genealogies of the Pāṇḍya kings as given in the Sanskrit and Tamiḻ portions differ widely; but still as both refer to the same grant, which was made in the sixteenth year of the same king, there cannot be any room for doubt. Consequently, the statements of the Sanskrit and the Tamiḻ portions have to be supplemented one with the other, in order to obtain a complete genealogy (<hi rend="italic">see</hi> Table D in the attached sheet of genealogical tables).</p>						

						<p>The smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates, after the usual invocation to god Purushōttama (Vishṇu) (v. 1), confer a benediction on the family of the Moon, in which were born the (Pāṇḍya) kings who crushed the pride of the enemies of gods (v. 2).</p>						

						<p>In that family of the Moon, after many kings of great deeds had expired, came forth a son of Jayantavarman, the great king (<hi rend="italic">paramēśvara</hi>) Arikēsari Asamasaman Alaṅghyavikrama Akālakāla Māṟavarman. His son was one who fought battles at Marudūr and Kuvaḷaimalai. Here comes a break and one or two plates on which the genealogy should have been continued, are lost. What is left on the last plate treats only of the description of the boundary line of the granted land or village, and mentions the Bhagavatī temple of Koṟṟaṉputtūr. The <hi rend="italic">āṇatti</hi>) of the grant was Tāyaṉ Śiṅgaṉ, the <hi rend="italic">uttaramantri</hi> of Kuṇḍūr in Kuṇḍūrkūṟṟam of Aṇḍa-nāḍu. The <hi rend="italic">puraṅkāval</hi> of this village was eighty-five <hi rend="italic">kalams</hi> (of paddy). The king himself, as in the Vēḷvikuḍi plates (ll. 151-152), made a declaration and caused the copper-plate grant to be executed. It may be noted that Koṟṟaṉputtūr mentioned above, also figures among the boundaries of Vēḷvikuḍi. The record was written (or witnessed) by Arikēsari, son of Pāṇḍi-Perumbaṇaikkāraṉ who also wrote the Madras Museum plates.</p>						

						<p>Before proceeding further, it is necessary to have clearly before us the genealogical tables supplied by the four Pāṇḍya copper-plate grants, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, (A) the Vēḷvikuḍi grant, (B) the Madras Museum plates, (C) the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates and (D) the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates, severally. For convenience of reference, it will be noted that the numbers given to the kings in the Vēḷvikuḍi table are repeated in the other tables in cases where, for reasons explained in the sequel, the kings are identical.</p>

						<p>From the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates.</p>						

						<p>The Pāṇḍyas were descended from the Moon; had Agastya for their family priest. In this family were born (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a king who subdued and relieved Vijaya (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Arjuna) from the curse of Vasu, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Sundara-Pāṇḍya, a helmsman in the ocean of <hi rend="italic">Śāstras, (c</hi>) a king whose surname was Pūḻiyaṉ, (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) a king who stood firmly in the field of battle at Pāḻi and obtained the title Pañchavaṉ, (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) the builder of Madura with its surrounding wall, (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) a king who cut off the heads of two kings in the battles at Chitramuyari and Talaiyālaṅgānam.</p>						

						<p>(6) Arikēsari Parāṅkuśa: king of the Pañchavas; defeated the Chēra king at Nelvēli and the Pallava king at Saṅkaramaṅgai</p>						

						<p>(7) Jaṭila</p>						

						<p>(8) Rājasiṁha (II)</p>						

						<p>(9) Varaguṇa (I) or Varaguṇa-Mahārāja.</p>						

						<p>(10) Srī-Māṟa, Śrīvallabha, Parachakrakōlāhala: fought successful battles at Kuṇṇūr, Siṅgaḷam and Viḻiñam; defeated at Kuḍamūkkil the Gaṅga, Pallava, Chōḷa, etc.; conquered Māyā-Pāṇḍya, the Kēraḷa, the Siṁhaḷa, the Pallava and the Vallabha.</p>						

						<p>(11) Varaguṇa II or Varaguṇavarman: succeeded to the throne in A.D. 862.</p>						

						<p>(12) Parāntaka Vīranārāyaṇa Saḍaiyaṉ: fought battles at Kharagiri, Śeṉṉilam Nilambēr and Kuḻumbūr; destroyed Peṇṇāgaḍam; won battles in the Koṅgu country; subdued the whole of Jambudvīpa (Nāvaltīvu) and married Vāṉavaṉmahādēvī.</p>						

						<p>(13) Rājasiṁha (III): entitled Vikaṭavāḍavaṉ, ‘the banner of both the solar and the lunar races’; fought battles at Ulappinimaṅgalam, Naippūr and Koḍumbai; burnt Vañji on the northern bank of the river Kāvērī; fought a battle at Nāval where he defeated the lord of southern Tañjai and was the donor of Naṟcheygaiputtūr or Mandaragauravamaṅgalam.</p>						

						<p>The description of the three kings given in the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates enables us to identify at once the last who fought the battle at Marudūr with (5) Śaḍaiyaṉ Raṇadhīra of the Vēḷvikuḍi plates and his father with (4) Arikēsari Asamasaman Māṟavarman of the same. From this it further follows that Jayantavarman the father of Arikēsari Asamasaman must be identified with (3) Śeḻiyaṉ Śēndaṉ. Mr. K.V.Subrahmanya Ayyar suggests that Jayantavarman is perhaps a Sanskritized form of Śēndaṉ. Thus the three kings referred to in the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr record, must be Nos. (3), (4) and (5) of Mr. Venkayya's genealogical table given at page 54 of part II of the Madras <hi rend="italic">Epigraphical Report</hi> for 1908. It is, therefore, difficult to see how or why Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya must have been inclined to attribute the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates to Parāntaka Vīranārāyaṇa Śaḍaiyaṉ of the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates (D), who comes three generations after (7) of the Vēḷvikudi grant, especially after seeing that the three names mentioned in the smaller set are evidently only the first three names of what might have been a longer genealogy, similar to that of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant or the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates. The Madras Museum plates of Jaṭilavarman and the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates, palaeographically, are almost of the same period, and if, as proved in my paper on the Vēḷvikuḍi grant, the donor of the Madras Museum plates is identical with the donor of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant, it follows that the donor of the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates too must be either Parāntaka Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant or an immediate successor of his. So, the missing plate or plates after the second in the smaller Śiṉṉamaṉūr set should have contained the names of (5) Śaḍaiyaṉ Raṇadhīra, (6) Tērmāṟaṉ, (7) Parāntaka Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ and perhaps also his successor Rājasiṁha II. It is very disappointing that these plates are lost; else, we would have had enough material to compare the genealogies and to identify the names.</p>						

						<p>In comparing next, the historical Pāṇḍya genealogy derived from the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates with that of the Vēḻvikuḍi grant, one has to be guided not only by the common names and titles of kings belonging to about the same age, but also by the common battles fought and the common enemies conquered by them—though it is not impossible that these may be repeated in history. Palaeographical similarities no doubt often help in the identification of names but sometimes they also fail when the particular inscription from which we draw the inference happens to be a copy of some older document, written in a latter hand. Applying these methods we find that the first king Arikēsari of the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates, who is said to have fought the battle of Nelvēli against a Chēra king, will at first appear to be the same as Arikēsari Māṟavarman (No. 4) of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant whose enemy at Nelvēli was a certain Vilvēli<note n="447-1">Dr. Krishnaswami Ayyangar suggests, however, that Vilvēli here may probably be synonymous with Pallava, since Tirumaṅgai-Āḻvār, in his Periya-Tirumoḻi makes Villavaṉ synonymous with Pallava. But it must be noted that Vilvēli is different from Villavaṉ.</note> (perhaps a Chēra). But Arikēsari of (A) did not, however, fight with the Pallava king as did Arikēsari mentioned in (D). The battle of Śaṅkaramaṅgai where Parāṅkuśa Arikēsari of (D) defeated the Pallavas is not mentioned of No. 4 in (A) but Tērmāṟaṉ (No. 6) a grandson of Arikēsari (No. 4) is clearly said to have crushed the Pallava power. Again, the title Parāṅkuśa, given to Arikēsari in the Tamiḻ portion of (D) makes it difficult to connect him with the first Arikēsari Māṟavarman (No. 4) of the Vēḷvikuḍi plates. So, it has to be assumed, at least hypothetically, that a second battle was fought at Nelvēli by Parāṅkuśa Arikēsari, like the first by his grandfather, Asamasaman Arikēsari, against the very same or a different Chēra king. The fact that Parāṅkuśa Arikēsari's grandson is called Rājasiṁha in (D) suggests the possibility of Arikēsari himself being also called Rājasiṁha, which title we actually find for the first time given to Tērmāṟaṉ in the Vēḷvikuḍi plates. Thus, the battle of Śaṅkaramaṅgai and the defeat of Pallavamalla and a possible second battle at Nelvēli are the only common factors that might enable us to connect the genealogy of the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates with that of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant. Parāṅkuśa Arikēsari must therefore be No. 6 Tērmāṟaṉ, the contemporary of Pallavamalla (Cir. A.D. 760) as we learn from the Vēḷvikuḍi grant. If this is admitted, Tērmāṟaṉ (No. 6) of (A) must be presumed to have also had the titles Arikēsarin and Parāṅkuśa, to have defeated the Pallavas at Śaṅkaramaṅgai before actually crushing Pallavamalla in the battles at Kuḻumbūr and Periyalūr and to have fought a second battle at Nelvēli against an unnamed Chēra.<note n="448-1"><hi rend="italic">Ep. Ind</hi>., Vol. XVII, pp. 293 and 295.</note> </p>						

						<p>Of king Jaṭila, the second in the genealogical list (D) given above, nothing is stated in the plates in the Sanskrit portion, the Tamiḻ portion omitting his name altogether. On the hypothesis, however, of Arikēsari Parāṅkuśa being identical with Tērmāṟaṉ of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant, Jaṭila will have to be identified with (No. 7) Parāntaka Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ, the donor of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant—it being inexplicable, however, why this king of whom we hear so much in the Vēḷvikuḍi and in the Madras Museum plates, should have been mentioned without any remarks in the Sanskrit portion and omitted altogether in the Tamiḻ portion. The other kings who follow are later names in the Pāṇḍya genealogy and their achievements are detailed in the genealogical table (D) given above.</p>						

						<p>The successor of Jaṭila was Rājasiṁha (II)<note n="448-2">Tērmāṟaṉ was Rājasiṁha I.</note> of whom nothing is stated. After him came Varaguṇa or Varaguṇa-Mahārāja of great prowess who was separated by two generations or roughly 50 years from Tērmāṟaṉ (No. 6 of A) the contemporary of Pallavamalla Nandivarman already mentioned. Consequently, he should have flourished about the beginning of the 9th century A.D. Though very scanty information is supplied about this king by the bigger Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates, still he is familiar to students of epigraphy and we know of very many references in inscriptions to Varaguṇa or Varaguṇa-Mahārāja<note n="448-3"><hi rend="italic">Ep. Ind</hi>., Vol. IX, p. 86 f.</note> , sometimes also called Māṟañjaḍaiyaṉ. We learn, e.g., that Varaguṇa, for the first time, carried his conquests north ward into the Chōḷa country against Iḍavai<note n="448-4">No. 690 of 1905.</note> on which occasion also he should perhaps have destroyed the fortified walls of Vēmbil (Vēmbaṟṟūr). Varaguṇa thence pushed further north into the Toṇḍai-nāḍu making there a grant from his camp at Araiśūr, a village on the banks of the Pennar to the temple of Erichchā-Uḍaiyār at Ambāsamudram in the Tinnevelly district. Again, an inscription at Kaḻugumalai<note n="448-5">No. 43 of the <hi rend="italic">Madras Epigraphist's Collection</hi> for 1908.</note> , also in the Tinnevelly district, supports the above statement by referring to an expedition of the king (herein called only Māṟañjaḍaiyaṉ) against Arividūrkkōṭṭai and casually mentions the village Pūndaṇmali (i.e., Poonamalli) in Toṇḍai-nāḍu. The Tiruviśalūr inscription dated in the 4th year of the reign of Varaguṇa-Mahārāja might also belong to this same king<note n="448-6">Mr. K.V.Subrahmanya Ayyar thinks that this belongs to Varaguṇavarman II, but the title Mahārāja added to his name in the Tiruviśalūr record leaves no doubt that he is the first of that name.</note> . The Aivarmalai inscription which supplies the initial date Śaka 784 or A.D. 862 to Varaguṇa must refer to the later Varaguṇavarman who was the grandson of Varaguṇa I. An inscription from Tiruveḷḷaṟai which is dated in his 13th year, and where the king is called Māṟañjaḍaiyaṉ supplies astronomical details for the verification of the date. The actual calculation, worked out by Mr. Sewell at page 253 of <hi rend="italic">Ep. Ind</hi>., Vol. XI, fits in with the 13th year of this Varaguṇavarman II, viz., Monday the 22nd November, A.D. 874. This is the second sure date in the Pāṇḍya chronology, the first being A.D. 769-70 (or thereabouts) of the Āṉamalai inscription, for king Maṟañjaḍaiyaṉ Parāntaka, Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ, the donor of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant and of the Madras Museum plates. Thus the initial date of Varaguṇa II got from the Aivarmalai inscription, is A.D. 862 and the nearest possible date of Parāntaka Neḍuñjaḍaiyaṉ is A.D. 770. The difference between these two dates <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> 92 years, suggests at least four generations and Rai Bahadur Venkayya has, accordingly in his genealogical table of the Pāṇḍyas given at page 54 of his <hi rend="italic">Annual Report on Epigraphy</hi> for 1908, Part II, taken the Varaguṇa of the Aivarmalai inscription to be the second of that name who, according to the Udayēndiram plates, killed the Gaṅga king Pṛithvīpati I in the battle at Śrīpurambiyam or Tiruppurambiyam near Kumbhakōṇam, being himself subsequently defeated by the last Pallava king Aparājita or Aparājitavikramavarman son of Nṛipatuṅga<note n="449-1"><hi rend="italic">Annual Report on Epigraphy</hi> for 1906, Part II, p. 64, paragraph 9.</note> . Leaving alone the second Varaguṇavarman for the present, it may be stated that in the time of Varaguṇa-Mahārāja I the Pāṇḍya dominion was largely extended as to include in it the Chōḷa and the Pallava country right up to the bank of the Pennār in Toṇḍai-nāḍu. This invasion could not have been allowed to pass without severe resistance by the kings concerned, viz., the Chōḷas and the Pallavas, and consequently, we see that in the next reign king Śrīvallabha (10) had to fight fierce battles, three of them being at Kuḍamūkkil, i.e., Kumbhakōṇam in the heart of the Chōḷa country, against perhaps the allied Chōḷas, Gaṅgas and Pallavas.<note n="449-2">He carried his conquest also into Siṁhaḷa. The <hi rend="italic">Mahāvaṁśa</hi> says that Aggabōdhi and Śēna killed Mahinda and his brothers who returned to the island from the opposite coast.</note> This was perhaps the commencement of the struggle. It perhaps ended only with the defeat of Varaguṇa II, by the Pallava king Aparājita at Śrīpurambiyam, near Kumbhakōṇam, where his Gaṅga ally Pṛithivīpati I also died. The Chōḷa enemies of the Pāṇḍyas, now turned against their allies, the Pallavas Rājakēsarivarman Āditya I overran the Toṅḍai-nāḍu in the north and occupied it. But the Pāṇḍya king Rājasiṁha III (No. 13), the son of Parāntaka Śaḍaiyaṉ, defeated the king of Tañjai (Tanjore) at Naippūr, fought a battle at Koḍumbai (Koḍumbāḷūr) the seat of one of the powerful Chōḷa subordinates, burnt Vañji and destroyed the king of southern Tañjai (perhaps another subordinate of the Chōḷas) at Nāval. Āditya's son Parāntaka I defeated this Rājasiṁha-Pāṇḍya, the nephew of Varaguṇa II and captured the Pāṇḍya capital Madura, thereby acquiring for himself the wellknown title Madiraikoṇḍa. The mention of Māyā-Pāṇḍya as in rebellious union against Śrīvallabha (10) and that of Ugra (perhaps also a Pāṇḍya king) against Parāntaka Vīranārāyaṇa Śaḍaiyaṉ (12) show internal dissensions in the Pāṇḍya family which must have been the cause of their eventual downfall. The Pāṇḍya king Parāntaka appears to have courted the friendship of the rising powerful Chōḷa and to have married Vāṉavaṉmahādēvī, evidently a Chōḷa princess as the title<note n="449-3">A similar title was assumed by Varaguṇa of the Trichinopoly cave inscription. The solar family to which he belonged on his mother's side, may have been the Chōḷa.</note> the flag of both the lunar and the solar races'<note type="repeated" n="449-3"/> borne by his son Rājasiṁha clearly shows. </p>						

						<p>Of the topographical and other proper names mentioned in both the sets of Śiṉṉamaṉūr plates, viz., Chitramuyari, Talaiyālaṅgānam, Nelvēli, Śaṅkaramaṅgai, Kuṇṇūr, Śiṅgaḷam, Viḻiñam, Kuḍamūkkil, Śeṉṉilam, Kharagiri, Peṇṇāgaḍam, Koṅgu, Ulappinimaṅgalam, Tañjai, Naippūr, Koḍumbai, Vañji [on the northern bank of the Poṉṉi (Kāvērī) river], Nāval, Chūḻal, Rājasiṅgapperuṅguḷakkīḻ, Naṟcheygaiputtūr, Aḷa-nāḍu, Puttūr, Mīyguṇḍāṟu, Koḻuvūr-kūṟṟam, Maṇiyāchi or Tiśaichchuḍarmaṅgalam, Vaḍa-Kaḷavaḻināḍu, Pullamaṅgalam, Śōḻa-nāḍu, Vēmbaṟṟūr in Kaḷavaḻi-nāḍu, Kūra in Kīḻ-Vēmba-nāḍu, Śuruḷi-āṟu (river), Marudūr, Kuvaḷaimalai, Koṟṟaṉputtūr, Kuṇḍūr and Aṇḍa-nāḍu, almost all are familiar and known to us from inscriptions. The first two are not identified, the second being known only to literature. Kuḍamūkkil is Kumbhakōṇam; Viḻiñam is a port in the Travancore State; Śiṅgaḷam is Ceylon; Peṇṇāgaḍam is a village in the Tanjore District; Koṅgu comprises the modern districts of Salem and Coimbatore; Tañjai is the well-known Tanjore; Koḍumbai is Koḍumbāḷūr in the Pudukkōṭṭai State. Rājaśiṅgakuḷakkīḻ may be identified with Rājaśiṅgamaṅgalam in the Śivagaṅga Zamīndāri. It is called Varaguṇamaṅgalam in its inscriptions. Naṟcheygaiputtūr must be identical with Śiṉṉamaṉūr in the Periyakuḷam taluk where these plates were obtained. The stone inscriptions of the place, however, show that it bore the name Arikēsarinallūr and was a <hi rend="italic">brahmadēya</hi> in Aḷa-nāḍu, a subdivision of Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam.<note n="450-1"><hi rend="italic">Madras Epigraphical Collection</hi> for 1907, Nos. 427, 428, 432 and 441.</note> A hamlet of it was Koṟṟaṉputtūr, identical, perhaps, with the native village of the donee.<note n="450-2"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> No. 442.</note> Mention is also made in stone inscriptions of the places Mandaragauravamaṅgalam and Arapadaśēkharamaṅgalam, which had assemblies similar to that of Arikēsarinallūr that met together in a common place, evidently showing that these places were not far distant from each other.<note n="450-3"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> Nos. 439 and 452.</note> Aḷa-nāḍu is the territorial division in which Śiṉṉamaṉūr was situated. Kōttārpoḻil-Puttūr is identical with Tirupputtūr in the Ramnad district and is the headquarters of a taluk. From No. 90 of the Madras Epigraphical collection for 1908, we learn that it was situated in Mīguṇḍāṟu in Koḻuvūr-kūṟṟam, which is the description given of Kōttārpoḻil-Puttūr in these plates. Pullamaṅgalam is a village in the Pāpanāśam taluk of the Tanjore district. It was situated in Kilār-kūṟṟam. Kīḻ-Vēmba-nāḍu is a subdivision of the Pāṇḍya country in which Tinnevelly was situated. As such, the village of Kūra must be looked for near about Tinnevelly. Śuruḷiyāṟu is the river that takes its rise from the Śuruḷi-malai, 7 miles from Cumbum in the Periyakuḷam taluk of the Madura district, and flows past Cumbum and Śiṉṉamaṉūr and joins the Vaigai. Aṇḍa-nāḍu is that territorial division of the Pāṇḍya country in which Periyakōṭṭai in the Dindigul taluk was. Hence Kuṇḍūr and Koṟṟaṉputtūr must be traced out in that locality.</p>

<h4>Sanskrit portion.</h4>

<p>(Verse. 1.) The ocean, in whose rows of bounding disturbed waves, as in a dancing hall, are (<hi rend="italic">seen</hi>) like gems the sun, the stars and the moon, even when agitated at the end of the <hi rend="italic">Kalpa</hi>, bore the form of his foot-stool.<note n="456-7">The missing invocatory verses and the abrupt introduction of a king (perhaps named Pāṇḍya) whose greatness is described by verse 1, show that at least a single plate should have been lost, at the beginning. The submission of the ocean to the Pāṇḍyas was a family tradition on which see <hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XXII, p. 73, foot-note 80; Compare V. 4 of the Vēḷvikuḍi grant, <hi rend="italic">Ep. Ind</hi>., Vol. XVII, p. 298.</note> </p>

<p>(V. 2.) (<hi rend="italic">Victorious</hi>) was the family of him whose prowess had filled the earth and was a sun (<hi rend="italic">in destroying</hi>) the night (<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>) the great heroism of its enemies. The kings of great glory and merited fame born in this (<hi rend="italic">family</hi>), held the earth as their legally married wife.</p>

<p>(V. 3.) Of the kings born in this (<hi rend="italic">family</hi>) who had destroyed all enemy kings and had their edicts established on the snowy mountain, the priest was the venerable Agastya.</p>

<p>(V. 4.) One (<hi rend="italic">of the kings</hi>) born here, whose wealth was his honour, and who had killed the powerful demons in a battle between the gods and the demons, sat alone on the throne of the Lord of the gods (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>), Indra) in heaven brought down (<hi rend="italic">to earth</hi>).</p>

<p>(V. 5.) Another wise king of right conduct, was an ambassador to secure victory for the gods; and (<hi rend="italic">still</hi>) another of unopposed commands, caused the Ten-headed giant (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Rāvaṇa) to sue for peace.</p>

<p>(V. 6.) (<hi rend="italic">Again</hi>), in that family was born a king who was the husband of (Gaṅgā) the daughter of the friend of <hi rend="bold">Nara</hi> (Arjuna) (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Vishṇu), who (like Śiva) had three eyes (trilōchana)<note n="457-1">It is not likely that here we have to take Trilōchana as a proper name. Pāṇḍya kings in general are mentioned in Vv. 4—9; and no particular person, excepting Sundara-Pāṇḍya of V. 8, is mentioned by name</note> whose virtue was praised by the three worlds, a matchless king who stirred the ocean and was a pupil of <hi rend="bold">Agastya</hi>.</p>

<p>(V. 7.) (<hi rend="italic">Another</hi>) born in that (<hi rend="italic">family</hi>) was adorned with the necklace of <hi rend="bold">Hari</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Indra</hi>) (<hi rend="italic">which he had</hi>) captured (<hi rend="italic">from him</hi>) after breaking (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) wristlet on the head of the Lord of gods (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Indra</hi>); still (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) king born in that (<hi rend="italic">family</hi>) conquered <hi rend="bold">Vijaya</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Arjuna) and was the conflagration at the end of time to the cotton (<hi rend="italic">namely</hi>) the army of the lord of the <hi rend="bold">Kurus</hi>.</p>

<p>(V. 8.) Another (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) born in that (<hi rend="italic">family</hi>) cut off his own head in order to save his master; and (<hi rend="italic">a king</hi>) named <hi rend="bold">Sundara-Pāṇḍya</hi> born in this (<hi rend="italic">family</hi>) was a helmsman in the ocean of all Śāstras.</p>

<p>(V. 9.) Countless number of emperors and kings born in this race attained godhood having performed numberless <hi rend="italic">Rājasūya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aśvamēdha</hi> sacrifices. Which mortal could describe them thoroughly ?</p>

<p>(V. 10.) In that family was born king <hi rend="bold">Arikēsari</hi>, the home of glory, who had controlled his passions. His son (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Jaṭila</hi>. His son (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) the glorious (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) virtuous king <hi rend="bold">Rājasiṁha</hi>. His son (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) the wise <hi rend="bold">Varaguṇa</hi> of great prowess. His son (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) king <hi rend="bold">Śrī-Māra</hi> whose fame was delightful to hear and who was the invincible lord of wealth (<hi rend="italic">Śrīvallabha</hi>).</p>

<p>(V. 11.) He (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Śrī-Māra</hi>) the matchless hero, the beloved of his subjects, having conquered in battle <hi rend="bold">Māyā-Pāṇḍya</hi>, the <hi rend="bold">Kēraḷa</hi>, the king of <hi rend="bold">Siṁhaḷa</hi>, the <hi rend="bold">Pallava</hi> and the <hi rend="bold">Vallabha</hi>, protected the earth under (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) one umbrella.</p>

<p>(V. 12.) His son, the younger brother of king <hi rend="bold">Varaguṇa</hi>, was the virtuous king <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi>, whose lotus-feet were brightened by the spreading lustre of the sun-like gems in the crowns of (<hi rend="italic">prostrating</hi>) kings.</p>

<p>(V. 13.) He quickly captured in a battle near <hi rend="bold">Kharagiri</hi> the powerful (king) Ugra who possessed a herd of strong elephants whose tusks were red with the blood of enemy kings with an army (<hi rend="italic">which was</hi>) the only sword (<hi rend="italic">held</hi>) in hand.</p>

<p>(V. 14.) This emperor, himself of meritorious fame, caused the circle of the earth to be filled with holy boundless Brāhmin settlements<note n="458-1">The word <hi rend="italic">agrāhāra</hi> is used in place of the usual word <hi rend="italic">agrahāra</hi>, for the sake of the metre.</note> , numerous temples and countless tanks.</p>

<p>(V. 15.) The wife of that king was the glorious <hi rend="bold">Vānavanmahādēvī</hi>, as <hi rend="bold">Śrī</hi> (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) of <hi rend="bold">Śrīnivāsa</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Vishṇu) and as <hi rend="bold">Paulōmī</hi> (Śachī) (<hi rend="italic">was</hi>) of <hi rend="bold">Śatakratu</hi> (Indra).</p>

<p>(V. 16.) Of this queen was born to him, who was the abode of prosperity, the son, king <hi rend="bold">Rājasimha</hi> who was the repository of intelligence, valour, stability, courage, nobility and liberality and who successfully scared away the heroism of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) enemies.</p>

<p>(V. 17.) Having obtained him, the banner of (<hi rend="italic">both</hi>) the (<hi rend="italic">solar) (and the lunar</hi>) races, who caused the utmost grief to the host of enemy kings, satisfaction to the crowds of supplicants and fame (<hi rend="italic">to reach</hi>) all directions, the earth (<hi rend="italic">now</hi>) became (<hi rend="italic">truly</hi>) possessed of a king.</p>

<p>(V. 18.) The requests of all supplicants are not enough for (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, to satisfy) his liberality; nor the enemies for his prowess; nor all the worlds for (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) lustrous fame; nor (<hi rend="italic">again</hi>) the words of the Master of Words (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Bṛihaspati) for praising (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) virtues.</p>

<p>(V. 19.) Dignified as <hi rend="bold">Bharata</hi>, he rules the earth filling all Brahmans with endless wealth, the enemies with ruin which fully deprives (<hi rend="italic">them</hi>) of (<hi rend="italic">their</hi>) wealth and the ten quarters with faultless fame.</p>

<p>(V. 20.) A great favourite of this lord, the king, was the glorious son of the illustrious <hi rend="bold">Śrēshṭhiśarman</hi>, who was famous by the well-known name <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi>, who was born in the <hi rend="bold">Kauśika</hi> lineage, was possessed of wealth which was learning, who was the best of the upright and of famous descent, who was widely known, wise, dutiful and virtuous, of excellent character and highly modest.</p>

<p>(V. 21.) This (Parāntaka) who was ever devoted for the good of others, who was the ocean (<hi rend="italic">into which emptied itself</hi>) the river of learning and who was the Pārijāta (<hi rend="italic">celestial</hi>) tree (<hi rend="italic">in fulfilling</hi>) the desires of all classes of wise men, was the grandson of him who was named <hi rend="bold">Bhāskara</hi>, the sole repository of the <hi rend="bold">Trayī</hi> (Vēdas), and the great-grandson of him named <hi rend="bold">Śrēshṭhin</hi> who was the purest of the <hi rend="bold">Śeṅkuṭi-Kauśikas</hi> of great religious austerity born in <hi rend="bold">Puttūr</hi>, a mine of knowledge and modesty and the home of prosperity.</p>

<p>(V. 22.) His ancestors who had reached the (<hi rend="italic">other</hi>) end of Vēdic (<hi rend="italic">learning</hi>) established on this earth the extensive work called <hi rend="italic">Kalpa</hi> written by <hi rend="bold">Āgnivēśya</hi><note n="458-2">Perhaps they were proficient in the <hi rend="italic">Āgnivēśya-kalpa</hi>, the doctrine of medicine in which Āgnivēśya is said to have been a predecessor of Suśruta.</note> .</p>

<p>(V. 23.) His maternal grandfather was the famous <hi rend="bold">Ūraśarman</hi>, the chief of the residents of <hi rend="bold">Syandana-grāma</hi>, of the <hi rend="bold">Maudgalya</hi> (lineage), who was of high birth and noble character, illustrious, intelligent, famous and a prop of virtue.</p>

<p>(V. 24.) Knowledge, noble conduct, wealth, modesty, praiseworthy riches, a conscience ever attached to the lotus-feet of the lord of <hi rend="bold">Lakshmī</hi> (Vishṇu), a descent ever high and pure, permanent fame and superior intelligence—these were the rule in the family of him (i.e., Ūrasarman) whose fame was widely known.</p>

<p>(Vv. 25—27.) His (i.e., Parāntaka's) father, the wise and illustrious <hi rend="bold">Śrēshṭhiśarman</hi>, whose conduct was pure, who was as powerful and glorious as <hi rend="bold">Pitāmaha</hi> (Brahma) who was the one resort of modesty, intelligent, good and of noble descent whose fame was pleasant to hear and who was the leader of the wise, received from the heroic (<hi rend="italic">king</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Parāntaka</hi>, lord <hi rend="bold">Vīranārāyaṇa</hi> of meritorious fame and an ornament of the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi> race, the Brahman village (<hi rend="italic">agrahāra</hi>) named <hi rend="bold">Maṇiyāchi</hi> of unfailing fertility, (<hi rend="italic">which was</hi>) a famous <hi rend="italic">agrahāra</hi> (situated) in <hi rend="bold">Vaḍa-Kaḷavaḷi-rāshṭra</hi><note n="459-1"><hi rend="italic">Rāshṭratah</hi> has evidently to be understood in the sense of <hi rend="italic">rāsṭrē</hi>.</note> re-naming (it) <hi rend="bold">Tiśaichchuḍarmaṅgala</hi>.</p>

<p>(Vv. 28—32.) The same god-like king of unfailing prosperity, who pleased the whole circle of the earth and satisfied (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) subjects, who destroyed the host of enemies, who was the banner of polity, whose prowess was (<hi rend="italic">equal to</hi>) that of <hi rend="bold">Śakra</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Indra) and who removed the troubles (<hi rend="italic">of the people</hi>) on the circle of the earth, <hi rend="bold">in the 16th year of his reign</hi>, while camping<note n="459-2">The word <hi rend="italic">āvāsāt</hi> may be compared with <hi rend="italic">āvāsakāt</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vāsakāt</hi> which often occur at the beginning of copper plate inscriptions.</note> in the famous village named <hi rend="bold">Chūḻal</hi> situated in the territorial division (<hi rend="italic">rāshṭra</hi>) called <hi rend="bold">Rājasiṁhakuḷakkīḻ</hi>, gave with libations of water, to the Brahman, <hi rend="bold">Parāntakaśarman</hi>, the whole of the matchless and excellent <hi rend="italic">agrahāra</hi> named <hi rend="bold">Naṟcheygai-Puttūr</hi> situated in <hi rend="bold">Aḷa-nāḍu</hi> which was famous with its (<hi rend="italic">second</hi>) name <hi rend="bold">Mandaragauravamaṅgalam</hi>, as a <hi rend="italic">brahmadēya</hi> property, together with (<hi rend="italic">its) kārāṇmai</hi> and <hi rend="italic">miyāṭchi</hi> and with (<hi rend="italic">its</hi>) four boundaries marked off by the circumambulation of the female elephant.</p>

<p>(V. 33.) The <hi rend="italic">vijñapti</hi> of this (grant) was the minister <hi rend="bold">Jaṭila</hi> of respectable descent and a storehouse of prosperity who was the councillor of the king and a poet of the <hi rend="bold">Atrigōtra</hi>, who had performed (Vēdic) sacrifices.</p>

<p>(V. 34.) The <hi rend="italic">ājñapti</hi> of this (grant) was the servant of that crest-jewel of warriors, the illustrious <hi rend="bold">Māravarman</hi>, who was descended of a pure family and was called <hi rend="bold">Kūṟṟaṅgōṉ</hi>.</p>

<p>(V. 35.)
