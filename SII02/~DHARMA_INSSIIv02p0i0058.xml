						<p>The outer face of the North wall of the temple enclosure bears five inscriptions, one of Kulōttuṅga and four of Rājarājadēva. Of these, only the top lines are visible, while the lower portions are buried underground to a depth of about five feet. With the permission of the Municipal authorities, I excavated the whole of the first inscription, as it is the only inscription of Kulōttuṅga at Tañjāvūr. It is dated in the 15th year of the reign of <hi rend="bold">Kō-Rājakēsarivarman</hi>, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> <hi rend="bold">Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷadēva</hi>, and opens with a panegyrical introduction, which describes the achievements of this king. Mr. V.Kanakasabhai Pillai has already published an inscription of the 42nd year of the same reign at <hi rend="bold">Tirukkaṛukkuṉṟam</hi> in the Chingleput district.<note n="230-1"><hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XXI, pp. 281 ff.</note> I have copies of a number of others. Three of these have the same introduction as the Tañjāvūr and Tirukkaṛukkuṉṟam inscriptions, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, one of the 18th year at the <hi rend="bold">Raṅganātha</hi> temple, Śrīraṅgam, one of the 45th year at <hi rend="bold">Ālaṅguḍi</hi> in the Tanjore district, and one of the 47th year at the <hi rend="bold">Jambukēśvara</hi> temple, Śrīraṅgam. Others resemble the so-called smaller Leyden grant.<note n="230-2">Dr. Burgess' <hi rend="italic">Archaeological Survey of Southern India</hi>, Vol IV, pp. 224 ff. The introduction of the Tiruvārūr inscription (p. 153, above) differs from both types of the introduction and appears to belong to a later king of the same name.</note> </p>						

						<p>The king, to whose reign these inscriptions belong, is identical with the hero of the <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi>, a historical poem in Tamil, extracts from which were published by Mr. Kanakasabhai.<note n="230-3"><hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XIX, pp. 329 ff.</note> This identity may be safely concluded from the mention of the following particulars both in the inscriptions and in the poem:—1. The conquest of <hi rend="bold">Chakrakōṭṭa</hi> by Kulōttuṅga, while he was still a <hi rend="italic">Yuvarāja</hi>.<note n="230-4">Text line If. of the present inscription, and canto x. verses 18 and 23.</note> 2. The battle at <hi rend="bold">Maṇalūr</hi><note n="230-5">Line 24, and xiii. 93.</note> on the <hi rend="bold">Tuṅgabhadrā</hi>.<note n="230-6">Line 25, and iv. 7.</note> 3. The defeat of the five <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍyas</hi>.<note n="230-7">Line 43, and xi. 69.</note> 4. The conquest of <hi rend="bold">Kōṭṭāṟu</hi>.<note n="230-8">Line 56, and iii. 21.</note> 5. The conquest of <hi rend="bold">Kaliṅga</hi>.<note n="230-9">This is described in the twelfth canto of the poem and referred to in two of Mr. Kanakasabhai's inscriptions and in the Ālaṅguḍi inscription �year.</note> 6. The name of one of Kulōttuṅga's queens, <hi rend="bold">Tyāgavallī</hi>.<note n="230-10">She is mentioned in canto x. verse 55, in two of Mr. Kanakasabhai's inscriptions. � and Jambukēśvara inscriptions.</note> 7. His surname <hi rend="bold">Jayadhara</hi>.<note n="230-11">This <hi rend="italic">biruda</hi> occurs at xi. 68 and <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>, and in two inscriptions of the 30th and 44th years at Tiruvoṟṟiyūr and Chidambaram.</note> </p>						

						<p>According to the <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Kulōttuṅga's</hi> father belonged to the lunar race, and his mother was the daughter of Rājarāja or Gaṅgaikoṇḍa-Chōḷa of the solar race.<note n="230-12"><hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XIX, p. 332.</note> As pointed out by Mr. Kanakasabhai and Dr. Fleet,<note n="230-13"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, Vol. XX, p. 279 f.</note> it follows from these statements, that the hero of the poem is identical with the Eastern <hi rend="bold">Chalukya</hi> king <hi rend="bold">Kulōttuṅga-Chōḍadēva</hi> I., who reigned from A.D. 1063 to 1112; that his unnamed father and mother were the Eastern <hi rend="bold">Chalukya</hi> king <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> I.<note n="230-14">No. 27 of the Table in Vol. I, p. 32.</note> and <hi rend="bold">Ammaṅgadēvī</hi>; and that his maternal grandfather, —though inaccurately called Rājarāja in the text of the poem,—was the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> king <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgaikoṇḍa-Chōḷa</hi>. A few important details regarding the reign of Kulōttuṅga I. are recorded in the <hi rend="bold">Chellūr</hi> grant of Vīra-Chōḍa.<note n="230-15">Vol. I. pp. 49 ff.</note> He was originally called <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḍa</hi>,—evidently after his maternal grandfather, the Chōḷa king Rājēndra-Chōḷa,—and ruled over the country of <hi rend="bold">Vēṅgī</hi>. Having conquered <hi rend="bold">Kērala, Pāṇḍya</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Kuntala</hi> (the country of the Western Chālukyas), he ascended the throne of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> kingdom under the name <hi rend="bold">Kulōttuṅgadēva</hi>. By his queen <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntakī</hi>, the daughter of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> king <hi rend="bold">Rājēndradēva</hi>, he had seven sons. His original dominion, the country of <hi rend="bold">Vēṅgī</hi>, he governed through viceroys, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, 1. his paternal uncle <hi rend="bold">Vijayā-</hi> <hi rend="bold">ditya</hi> VII. (A.D. 1063 to 1077); 2. his son <hi rend="bold">Rājarāja</hi> II. (A.D. 1077 to 1078); and 3. his son <hi rend="bold">Vīra-Chōḍa</hi> (A.D. 1078 to at least 1100). Some of these statements of the Chellūr grant are confirmed by the <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> and by the inscriptions of Kulōttuṅga. His original name <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva</hi> occurs in two inscriptions of the 2nd year of his reign at <hi rend="bold">Kōlār</hi> and at <hi rend="bold">Tiruvoṟṟiyūr</hi> near Madras, while all later inscriptions call him <hi rend="bold">Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷadēva</hi>. His early war with the king of <hi rend="bold">Kuntala</hi> is referred to in the subjoined inscription (1. 3), and his subsequent accession to the throne of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> kingdom, which had fallen into a state of anarchy, is recorded by the same inscription (ll. 4 to 9) and by the poem (x. 26 to 32). Victories over the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍyas</hi> are also narrated in the inscription (ll. 18 ff. and 39 ff.). The conquest of the <hi rend="bold">Kēralas</hi> is alluded to by the mention of the Western region (l. 32), of the Western hill-country (l. 54) and of the <hi rend="bold">Sahya</hi> mountain (l. 52). A short Sanskrit inscription at <hi rend="bold">Chidambaram</hi><note n="231-1">Vol. I, p. 168 f.</note> must be attributed to the same <hi rend="bold">Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa</hi> as the subjoined inscription, because it refers to the conquest of the five <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍyas</hi>, of Kōṭṭāra<note n="231-2">This word was previously misread by me as Korggāra, <hi rend="italic">l. c</hi>.</note> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Kōṭṭāṟu</hi>), of the <hi rend="bold">Kēraḷas</hi>, and of the <hi rend="bold">Sahya</hi> mountain.</p>						

						<p>There is yet another source for the history of Kulōttuṅga's reign,—Bilhaṇa's <hi rend="italic">Vikramāṅkadēvacharita</hi>. In this poem he is called “<hi rend="bold">Rājiga</hi>,<note n="231-3">Rājiga is a familiar abbreviation of <hi rend="bold">Rājēndra-Chōḷa</hi>, the original name of Kulōttuṅga; <hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XX, p. 282.</note> the lord of <hi rend="bold">Vēṅgī</hi>,” and his accession to the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> throne is placed immediately before the defeat of the Western <hi rend="bold">Chālukya</hi> king <hi rend="bold">Sōmēśvara</hi> II. and the coronation of the latter's younger brother <hi rend="bold">Vikramāditya</hi> VI. in A.D. 1076. According to the <hi rend="italic">Vikramāṅkacharita</hi>, Rājiga was the ally of Sōmēśvara II. and was put to flight by Vikramāditya VI. while Sōmēśvara II. was taken prisoner.<note n="231-4">Dr. Bu7hler's introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Vikramāṅkacharita</hi>, p. 37.</note> Those who know the habits of Indian court-poets, will not be surprised to find, that the inscriptions of Kulōttuṅga differ from the <hi rend="italic">Vikramāṅkacharita</hi> by claiming the victory for the Chōḷas. In the subjoined inscription (ll. 23 ff.) <hi rend="bold">Vikkalaṉ</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Vikramāditya VI., is said to have fled before Kulōttuṅga from <hi rend="bold">Naṅgili</hi> (in Maisūr) to the <hi rend="bold">Tuṅgabhadrā</hi> river, which appears to have then formed the southern limit of the Western Chālukya dominions. The smaller Leyden grant and a few similar inscriptions of Kulōttuṅga couple the name of Vikkalaṉ with that of <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaṇaṉ</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Jayasiṁha IV. whom his elder brother Vikramāditya VI. appointed viceroy of <hi rend="bold">Banavāse</hi>.<note n="231-5"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 38, and Dr. Fleet's <hi rend="italic">Kanarese Dynasties</hi>, p. 51.</note> As the <hi rend="italic">Vikramāṅkacharita</hi> places Rājiga's usurpation of the Chōḷa throne shortly before A.D. 1076, it follows that the reign of 49 years from A.D. 1063 to 1112, which one of the Eastern Chalukya grants<note n="231-6"><hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XIV, p. 55.</note> attributes to Kulōttuṅga, must include the time during which he was only heir-apparent of the Chōḷa kingdom. The name of his predecessor on the Chōḷa throne is not mentioned in the two chronicles. The <hi rend="italic">Vikramāṅkacharita</hi> relates that, before <hi rend="bold">Rājiga</hi> usurped the Chōḷa throne, <hi rend="bold">Vikramāditya</hi> VI. married the daughter of the then <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> king, and that after the latter's death he secured the throne to his wife's brother, who shortly after lost his life.<note n="231-7">Dr. Bu7hler's introduction, p. 35.</note> The <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> (x. 26) calls Kulōttuṅga's predecessor “the king of kings” (<hi rend="italic">maṉṉar maṉṉavaṉ</hi>). The eighth canto of the same poem contains a short summary of the history of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷas</hi>. The last verse (30) of this poetical history probably refers to the reign of Kulōttuṅga, and the preceding verse (29), which speaks of a king who defeated the <hi rend="bold">Kuntaḷas</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Western Chālukyas) at <hi rend="bold">Kūḍal-saṁgama</hi>, to Kulōttuṅga's predecessor on the throne. The battle at Kūḍal-saṁ- game, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, at the junction of the Tuṅgabhadrā and Kṛishṇā rivers,<note n="232-1"><hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XIX, p. 340.</note> is referred to in unpublished inscriptions of the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> king <hi rend="bold">Kō-Rājakēsarivarman</hi>, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> <hi rend="bold">Vīra-Rājēndradēva</hi>, who claims to have defeated <hi rend="bold">Āhavamalla</hi> (II.) and his two sons <hi rend="bold">Vikkalaṉ</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaṇaṉ</hi> at <hi rend="bold">Puṉal-kūḍal-saṁgama</hi>. An inscription of the 5th year of the reign of this king at <hi rend="bold">Maṇimaṅgalam</hi> in the Chingleput district proves that he was still reigning after A.D. 1063, the year of the accession of Vijayāditya VII. of Vēṅgī,<note n="232-2">The fact that Vīra-Rājēndra was still on the Chōḷa throne after A.D. 1063, confirms the account of the <hi rend="italic">Vikramāṅkacharita</hi>, according to which Kulōttuṅga took possession of the Chōḷa kingdom several years after A.D. 1063, the nominal date of his accession.</note> whom he alleges to have re-established in his dominions.<note n="232-3"><ta>veṅkai naṉāṭu mīṭṭukkoṇṭu taṉ pūṅkaḻaṟkaṭaikkalam puku</ta>n=ta <ta>paṭaikkalattaṭakkai</ta> vi<hi rend="grantha">jai</hi>yā<hi rend="grantha">-</hi> <ta>tittaṟkaruḷi;</ta> “having recovered the good country of Vēṅgai, (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) bestowed (<hi rend="italic">it</hi>) on Vijaiyādittaṉ, whose strong arm (<hi rend="italic">bore</hi>) the weapon, and who had taken refuge at his handsome feet.” Another “protector” of Vijayāditya VII. was Rājarāja of Kaliṅganagara (A.D. 1071 to 1078); <hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XVIII, p. 171.</note> This Vīra-Rājēndradēva appears to be “the king of kings” who preceded Kulōttuṅga, and the father-in-law of Vikramāditya VI. The verse of the <hi rend="italic">Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi</hi> which mentions the battle at Kūḍal-saṁgama, is preceded by another verse (27), which speaks of a king who won the battle at <hi rend="bold">Koppai</hi>. This statement must refer to the <hi rend="bold">Chōḷa</hi> king <hi rend="bold">Kō-Parakēsarivarman</hi>, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> <hi rend="bold">Rājēndradēva</hi>, whose inscriptions record that he defeated <hi rend="bold">Āhavamalla</hi> (II.) “at <hi rend="bold">Koppam</hi> on the bank of the big river,”<note n="232-4">Vol. I, p. 134.</note> <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, at Koppa on the Tuṅgā river in the Kaḍūr district of the Maisūr state. This Rājēndradēva is perhaps identical with that <hi rend="bold">Rājēndradēva</hi> of the solar race, whose daughter <hi rend="bold">Madhurāntakī</hi> was married to Kulōttuṅga according to the Chellūr grant. The subjoined table shows the somewhat complicated relations between Kulōttuṅga and his Chōḷa predecessors:—</p>						

						<table>[C1]<hi rend="italic">Chōḷas</hi>. Rājakēsarivarman, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Rājarājadēva [C2]<hi rend="italic">Eastern Chalukyas</hi>. Dānārṇava. [C1]Parakēsarivarman, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva I. [C2]Kūndavā, <hi rend="italic">married</hi> .. .. [C3]Vimalāditya. [C1]Parakēsarivarman, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Rājēndradēva. [C2]Ammaṅgadēvī, <hi rend="italic">married</hi> .. .. [C3]Rājarāja I. [C1]Rājakēsarivarman, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Vīra-Rājēndradēva. [C2]Madhurāntakī, <hi rend="italic">married</hi> .. [C3]Rājakēsarivarman, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva II. or Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷadēva I.</table>						

						<p>The last lines of the subjoined inscription contain the name of <hi rend="bold">Arumoṛi-Naṅgai</hi>, the queen of <hi rend="bold">Vīra-Rājēndradēva</hi>, who, as previously stated, appears to have been the predecessor of Kulōttuṅga. There are no traces of letters after the word <hi rend="italic">dēviyār</hi> in line 64, though there would have been sufficient room for further lines on the same panel. It appears, therefore, that the inscription was left unfinished by the engraver, perhaps because political or private reasons prevented Arumoṛi-Naṅgai from executing the donation, which she intended to make to the temple.</p>

<p>(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the wheel of his (<hi rend="italic">authority</hi>) rolled as far as the golden circle (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Mount Mēru) on the earth, which was surrounded by the moat of the sea, that was (<hi rend="italic">again</hi>) surrounded by (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) fame,—<hi rend="bold">Kō-Rājakēsarivarman</hi>, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> the emperor (<hi rend="italic">chakravartin</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Śrī-Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷadēva</hi>,<note n="234-8">The name of the king is taken from lines 59 ff. of the inscription.</note> wedded first in the time (<hi rend="italic">when he was still</hi>) heir-apparent (<hi rend="italic">iḷaṅgō</hi>), the brilliant goddess of victory at <hi rend="bold">Śakkarakōṭṭam</hi> (Chakrakōṭṭa)<note n="234-9">See Vol. I, p. 97, and Vol. II, p. 108. Two inscriptions of the 2nd year of the reign of Kō-Rājakēsarivarman, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷadēva I.) at Kōlār and Tiruvoṟṟiyūr read <ta>cakkarakoṭṭattuttārāvaracaṉaittikkunikaḻttiṟai koṇṭaruḷi;</ta> “(<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) was pleased to take tribute which illumined (<hi rend="italic">all</hi>) regions, from the king of Tārā (Dhārā) at Śakkarakōṭṭam.” Accordingly, Chakrakōṭṭa must be looked for in the dominions of the king of Dhārā; compare <hi rend="italic">Ind. Ant</hi>., Vol. XIX, p. 340, and Vol. XX, p. 280.</note> by deeds of valour.</p>

<p>(L. 2.) (<hi rend="italic">He</hi>) seized a herd of mountains of rut (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, rutting elephants) at <hi rend="bold">Vayirāgaram</hi> (Vajrākara).</p>

<p>(L. 3.) (<hi rend="italic">He</hi>) unsheathed (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) sword, showed the strength of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) arm, and spurred (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) war-steed, so that the army of the spear-throwing king of <hi rend="bold">Kondaḷa</hi> (Kuntala) retreated.</p>

<p>(L. 4.) Having established (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) fame, and having put on the garland of (<hi rend="italic">the victory over</hi>) the Northern region, (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) put on by right (<hi rend="italic">of inheritance</hi>) the pure royal crown<note n="235-1">The mention of the Lakshmī of the South and of the goddess of the country on the banks of the Kāvērī shows that the Chōḷa crown is meant.</note> of jewels, in order to stop<note n="235-2">Literally, “so that there might be removed.”</note> the prostitution of the goddess with the sweet and excellent lotus-flower (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Lakshmī) of the Southern region, and the loneliness of the goddess of the good country whose garment is the <hi rend="bold">Poṉṉi</hi> (Kāvērī).</p>

<p>(L. 9.) The kings of the old earth placed (<hi rend="italic">on their heads</hi>) his two feet as a large crown.</p>

<p>(L. 11.) The river (<hi rend="italic">of the rules</hi>) of the ancient king Manu swelled, (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) the river (<hi rend="italic">of the sins</hi>) of the Kali (<hi rend="italic">age</hi>) dried up.</p>

<p>(L. 12.) (<hi rend="italic">His</hi>) sceptre swayed over every region; the sacred shadow of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) white parasol shone (<hi rend="italic">as</hi>) the white moon everywhere on the circle of the great earth; (<hi rend="italic">and his</hi>) tiger (<hi rend="italic">banner)</hi><note n="235-3">The tiger is the emblem of the Chōḷas.</note> fluttered on the matchless Mēru (<hi rend="italic">mountain</hi>).</p>

<p>(L. 16.) (<hi rend="italic">Before him</hi>) stood many rows of elephants, unloaded from ships and presented as tribute by the kings of remote islands whose girdle was the sea.</p>

<p>(L. 18.) The big head of the brilliant king of the South (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍya</hi>) lay outside his golden town, being pecked by kites.</p>

<p>(L. 20.) Not only did the speech (<hi rend="italic">of</hi> Vikkalaṉ):—“After this day a permanent blemish (<hi rend="italic">will attach to</hi> Kuḷōttuṅga), as to the crescent (<hi rend="italic">which is the origin</hi>) of (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) family,”<note n="235-4">This taunt appears to allude to the lunar (Eastern Chalukya) descent of Kulōttuṅga and to his having joined the Chōḷas, who belonged to the solar race.</note> —turn out wrong, but the bow (<hi rend="italic">in</hi>) the hand of <hi rend="bold">Vikkalaṉ</hi> was not (<hi rend="italic">even</hi>) bent against (<hi rend="italic">the enemy</hi>).</p>

<p>(L. 23.) While (Vikkalaṉ) lost his pride, and while the dead (<hi rend="italic">bodies of his</hi>) furious elephants (<hi rend="italic">covered</hi>) the whole (<hi rend="italic">tract</hi>) from <hi rend="bold">Naṅgili</hi><note n="235-5">Naṅgili appears to be the same as Naṅgali, a village on the eastern extremity of the Muḷabāgal tālluqa of the Kōlār district of the Maisūr state.</note> of rocky roads to the <hi rend="bold">Tuṅgabhadrā</hi>, which adorned the country (<hi rend="italic">nāḍu</hi>) of <hi rend="bold">Maṇalūr</hi>,—(<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) boasted valour abated; the mountains which (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) ascended, bent their backs; the rivers into which (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) descended, eddied and breached (<hi rend="italic">their banks</hi>) in their course; (<hi rend="italic">and</hi>) the seas into which (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) plunged, became troubled and agitated.</p>

<p>(L. 32.) Being desirous of the rule over the Western region, (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) seized simultaneously the two countries (<hi rend="italic">pāṇi)</hi><note n="235-6">Another meaning of this sentence is:—“He seized simultaneously the two (<hi rend="italic">right</hi>) hands (<hi rend="italic">pāṇi</hi>) of, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, he married, the female personifications of these two countries.”</note> called <hi rend="bold">Gaṅgamaṇḍalam</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Śiṅgaṇam</hi>,<note n="235-7">Śiṅgaṇam is probably intended for Śiṅgana-maṇḍalam, the country of Siṁhaṇa, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Jayasiṁha IV.; compare line 2 of the smaller Leyden grant (Dr. Burgess' <hi rend="italic">Archaeological Survey of Southern India</hi>, Vol. IV, p. 224), where the sea is said to have rushed over Vikkalaṉ and Śiṅgaṇaṉ, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Vikramāditya VI. and Jayasiṁha IV.</note> troops of furious elephants which had been irretrievably abandoned (<hi rend="italic">by the enemy</hi>), crowds of women (<hi rend="italic">the angles of</hi>) whose beautiful eyes were as pointed as daggers, the goddess of fame, and the great goddess of victory, who changed to the opposite (<hi rend="italic">side</hi>) out of fear, because (Vikkalaṉ) himself and (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) father had turned their backs again and again on many days.</p>

<p>(L. 39.) Being pleased (<hi rend="italic">to resolve</hi>) in (<hi rend="italic">his</hi>) royal mind to conquer with great fame the <hi rend="bold">Pāṇḍimaṇḍalam</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Pāṇḍya country), (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) despatched his great army,—which possessed excellent horses (<hi rend="italic">resembling</hi>) the waves of the sea, war-elephants (<hi rend="italic">likewise resembling</hi>) waves, and troops (<hi rend="italic">resembling</hi>) water,—as though the Northern ocean was about to overflow the Southern ocean.</p>

<p>(L. 43.) (<hi rend="italic">He</hi>) destroyed the jungle which the five <hi rend="bold">Pañchavas</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, Pāṇḍyas) had entered as refuge, when they became much afraid on a battle-field where (<hi rend="italic">he</hi>) fought (<hi rend="italic">with them</hi>), turned their backs and fled.</p>

<p>(L. 46.) (<hi rend="italic">He</hi>) subdued (<hi rend="italic">their</hi>) country, made them catch hot fever (<hi rend="italic">in</hi>) hills where woodmen roamed about, and planted pillars of victory in every direction.</p>

<p>(L. 50.) (<hi rend="italic">He</hi>) was pleased to seize the pearl fisheries, the <hi rend="bold">Podiyil</hi> (<hi rend="italic">mountain)</hi><note n="236-1">This mountain, which is usually called Podiyam or Podigai (<hi rend="italic">Ind.
